# 4.2 Parabolas

---

n this section we want to look at the graph of a quadratic function. The most
general form of a quadratic function is,

$$ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$

The graphs of quadratic functions are called **parabolas**. Here are some
examples of parabolas.

![Chapter 4.2 Image 1](./4.2_1.png)

All parabolas are vaguely “U” shaped and they will have a highest or lowest
point that is called the **vertex**. Parabolas may open up or down and may or
may not have $x$-intercepts and they will always have a single $y$-intercept.

Note as well that a parabola that opens down will always open down and a
parabola that opens up will always open up. In other words, a parabola will not
all of a sudden turn around and start opening up if it has already started
opening down. Similarly, if it has already started opening up it will not turn
around and start opening down all of a sudden.

The dashed line with each of these parabolas is called the **axis of symmetry**.
Every parabola has an axis of symmetry and, as the graph shows, the graph to
either side of the axis of symmetry is a mirror image of the other side. This
means that if we know a point on one side of the parabola we will also know a
point on the other side based on the axis of symmetry. We will see how to find
this point once we get into some examples.

We should probably do a quick review of
[intercepts](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Graphing.aspx) before
going much farther. Intercepts are the points where the graph will cross the x
or y-axis. We also saw a graph in the section where we introduced intercepts
where an intercept just touched the axis without actually crossing it.

Finding intercepts is a fairly simple process. To find the $y$-intercept of a
function $y = f(x)$ all we need to do is set $x = 0$ and evaluate to find the
$y$ coordinate. In other words, the $y$-intercept is the point $(0, f(0))$. We
find $x$-intercepts in pretty much the same way. We set $y = 0$ and solve the
resulting equation for the $x$ coordinates. So, we will need to solve the
equation,

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

Now, let’s get back to parabolas. There is a basic process we can always use to
get a pretty good sketch of a parabola. Here it is.

Now, there are two forms of the parabola that we will be looking at. This first
form will make graphing parabolas very easy. Unfortunately, most parabolas are
not in this form. The second form is the more common form and will require
slightly (and only slightly) more work to sketch the graph of the parabola.

Let’s take a look at the first form of the parabola.

$$ f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k $$

There are two pieces of information about the parabola that we can instantly get
from this function. First, if $a$ is positive then the parabola will open up and
if $a$ is negative then the parabola will open down. Secondly, the vertex of the
parabola is the point $(h, k)$. Be very careful with signs when getting the
vertex here.

So, when we are lucky enough to have this form of the parabola we are given the
vertex for free.

Let’s see a couple of examples here.

---

**Example 1**

Sketch the graph of each of the following parabolas.

**(a)**

$$ f(x) = 2(x + 3)^2 - 8 $$

First, we need to find the vertex. We will need to be careful with the signs
however. Comparing our equation to the form above we see that we must have
$h = −3$ and $k = −8$ since that is the only way to get the correct signs in our
function. Therefore, the vertex of this parabola is,

$$ (-3, -8) $$

Now let's find the $y$-intercept. This is nothing more than a quick function
evaluation.

$$ f(0) = 2(0 + 3)^2 - 8 = 2(9) - 8 = 10 \text{ } y\text{-intercept: } (0, 10) $$

Next, we need to find the $x$-intercepts. This means we’ll need to solve an
equation. However, before we do that we can actually tell whether or not we’ll
have any before we even start to solve the equation.

In this case we have $a = 2$ which is positive and so we know that the parabola
opens up. Also the vertex is a point below the $x$-axis. So, we know that the
parabola will have at least a few points below the $x$-axis and it will open up.
Therefore, since once a parabola starts to open up it will continue to open up
eventually we will have to cross the $x$-axis. In other words, there are
$x$-intercepts for this parabola.

To find them we need to solve the following equation.

$$ 0 = 2(x + 3)^2 - 8 $$

We solve equations like this back when we were solving
[quadratic equations](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveQuadraticEqnsI.aspx)
so hopefully you remember how to do them.

$$ 2(x + 3)^2 = 8 $$

$$ (x + 3)^2 = 4 $$

$$ x + 3 = \pm \sqrt{4} = \pm 2 $$

$$ x = -3 \pm 2 \Rightarrow x = -1, x = -5 $$

The two $x$-intercepts are then,

$$ (-5, 0) \text{ and } (-1, 0) $$

Now, at this point we’ve got points on either side of the vertex so we are
officially done with finding the points. However, let’s talk a little bit about
how to find a second point using the $y$-intercept and the axis of symmetry
since we will need to do that eventually.

First, notice that the $y$-intercept has an x coordinate of 0 while the vertex
has an $x$ coordinate of -3. This means that the $y$-intercept is a distance of
3 to the right of the axis of symmetry since that will move straight up from the
vertex.

Now, the left part of the graph will be a mirror image of the right part of the
graph. So, since there is a point at y=10 that is a distance of 3 to the right
of the axis of symmetry there must also be a point at $y = 10$ that is a
distance of 3 to the left of the axis of symmetry.

So, since the $x$ coordinate of the vertex is -3 and this new point is a
distance of 3 to the left its $x$ coordinate must be -6. The coordinates of this
new point are then $(−6,10)$. We can verify this by evaluating the function at
$x = −6$. If we are correct we should get a value of 10. Let’s verify this.

$$ f(-6) = 2(-6 + 3)^2 - 8 = 2(-3)^2 - 8 = 2(9) - 8 = 18 - 8 = 10 $$

So, we were correct. Note that we usually don’t bother with the verification of
this point.

Okay, it’s time to sketch the graph of the parabola. Here it is.

![Chapter 4.2 Image 2](./4.2_2.png)

Note that we included the axis of symmetry in this graph and typically we won’t.
It was just included here since we were discussing it earlier.

**(b)**

$$ g(x) = -(x - 2)^2 - 1 $$

Okay with this one we won’t put in quite a much detail. First let’s notice that
$a = −1$ which is negative and so we know that this parabola will open downward.

Next, by comparing our function to the general form we see that the vertex of
this parabola is $(2,−1)$. Again, be careful to get the signs correct here!

Now let’s get the $y$-intercept.

$$ g(0) = -(0 - 2)^2 - 1 = (-2)^2 - 1 = -4 - 1 = -5 $$

The $y$-intercept is then $(0, -5)$.

Now, we know that the vertex starts out below the $x$-axis and the parabola
opens down. This means that there can’t possibly be $x$-intercepts since the $x$
axis is above the vertex and the parabola will always open down. This means that
there is no reason, in general, to go through the solving process to find what
won’t exist.

However, let’s do it anyway. This will show us what to look for if we don’t
catch right away that they won’t exist from the vertex and direction the
parabola opens. We’ll need to solve,

$$ 0 = -(x - 2)^2 - 1 $$

$$ (x - 2)^2 = -1 $$

$$ x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{-1} $$

$$ x - 2 = \pm i $$

$$ x = 2 \pm i $$

So, we got complex solutions. Complex solutions will always indicate no
$x$-intercepts.

Now, we do want points on either side of the vertex so we’ll use the
$y$-intercept and the axis of symmetry to get a second point. The $y$-intercept
is a distance of two to the left of the axis of symmetry and is at $y = −5$ and
so there must be a second point at the same $y$ value only a distance of 2 to
the right of the axis of symmetry. The coordinates of this point must then be
$(4,−5)$.

Here is the sketch of this parabola.

![Chapter 4.2 Image 3](./4.2_3.png)

**(c\)**

$$ h(x) = x^2 + 4 $$

$$ \text{vertex} = (0, 4) $$

Find $y$-intercept:

$$ h(0) = (0)^2 + 4 $$

$$ h(0) = 4 $$

Find $x$-intercepts:

$$ 0 = x^2 + 4 $$

$$ -4 = x^2 $$

$$ \pm \sqrt{-4} = \sqrt{x^2} $$

$$ \pm 2i = x $$

It never hits the $x$ axis. So instead let's take two points equidistant along
the $x$ axis and plug them in:

$$ h(2) = (2)^2 + 4  = (2, 8) $$

$$ h(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4 = (-2, 8) $$

Here is a sketch of the graph.

![Chapter 4.2 Image 4](./4.2_4.png)

---

Okay, we’ve seen some examples now of this form of the parabola. However, as
noted earlier most parabolas are not given in that form. So, we need to take a
look at how to graph a parabola that is in the general form.

$$ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$

In this form the sign of $a$ will determine whether or not the parabola will
open upwards or downwards just as it did in the previous set of examples. Unlike
the previous form we will not get the vertex for free this time. However, it is
easy to find. Here is the vertex for a parabola in the general form.

$$ \left(-\frac{b}{2a}, f\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)\right) $$

To get the vertex all we do is compute the $x$ coordinate from $a$ and $b$ and
then plug this into the function to get the $y$ coordinate. Not quite as simple
as the previous form, but still not all that difficult.

Note as well that we will get the $y$-intercept for free from this form. The
$y$-intercept is,

$$ f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c \Rightarrow (0, c) $$

So we won't need to do any computations for this one.

Let's graph some parabolas.

---

**Example 2**

Sketch the graph of each of the following parabolas.

**(a)**

$$ g(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 5 $$

Find the vertex:

$$ \left(-\frac{(-6)}{2(3)}, g\left(-\frac{(-6)}{2(3)}\right)\right) $$

$$ g(1) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 5 $$

$$ g(1) = 3 - 6 + 5 $$

$$ g(1) = -3 + 5 $$

$$ g(1) = 2 $$

$$ (1, 2) $$

Find the $y$-intercept:

$$ (0, 5) $$

![Chapter 4.2 Image 5](./4.2_5.png)

**(b)**

$$ f(x) = -x^2 + 8x $$

Find the vertex:

$$ \left(-\frac{(8)}{2(-1)}, f\left(-\frac{(8)}{2(-1)}\right)\right) $$

$$ (4, ?) $$

$$ f(4) = -(4)^2 + 8(4) $$

$$ f(4) = -16 + 32 $$

$$ f(4) = 16 $$

$$ (4, 16) $$

Find the $y$-intercept:

$$ (0, 0) $$

![Chapter 4.2 Image 6](./4.2_6.png)

**(c\)**

$$ f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4 $$

Find the vertex:

$$ \left(-\frac{(4)}{2(1)}, f\left(-\frac{(4)}{2(1)}\right)\right) $$

$$ (-2, ?) $$

$$ f(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 4 $$

$$ f(-2) = 4 - 8 + 4 $$

$$ f(-2) = -4 + 4 $$

$$ f(-2) = 0 $$

$$ (-2, 0) $$

Find $y$-intercept:

$$ (0, 4) $$

![Chapter 4.2 Image 7](./4.2_7.png)

As a final topic in this section we need to briefly talk about how to take a
parabola in the general form and convert it into the form

$$ f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k $$

This will use a modified
[completing the square](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveQuadraticEqnsII.aspx)
process. It's probably best to do this with an example.

---

**Example 3**

Convert each of the following into the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$.

Okay, as we pointed out above we are going to complete the square here. However,
it is a slightly different process than the other times that we’ve seen it to
this point.

**(a)**

$$ f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 $$

The thing that we’ve got to remember here is that we must have a coefficient of
1 for the $x^2$ term in order to complete the square. So, to get that we will
first factor the coefficient of the $x^2$ term out of the whole right side as
follows.

$$ f(x) = 2\left(x^2 - 6x + \frac{3}{2}\right) $$

Note that this will often put fractions into the problem that is just something
that we’ll need to be able to deal with. Also note that if we’re lucky enough to
have a coefficient of 1 on the $x^2$ term we won’t have to do this step.

Now, this is where the process really starts differing from what we’ve seen to
this point. We still take one-half the coefficient of $x$ and square it.
However, instead of adding this to both sides we do the following with it.

$$ \left(-\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9 $$

$$ f(x) = 2\left(x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9 + \frac{3}{2}\right) $$

We add and subtract this quantity inside the parenthesis as shown. Note that all
we are really doing here is adding in zero since $9 - 9 = 0$! The order listed
here is important. We MUST add first and then subtract.

The next step is to factor the first three terms and combine the last two as
follows.

$$ f(x) = 2\left((x - 3)^2 - \frac{15}{2}\right) $$

As a final step we multiply the 2 back through.

$$ f(x) = 2(x - 3)^2 - 15 $$

And there we go.

**(b)**

$$ f(x) = -x^2 + 10x - 1 $$

Be careful here. We don’t have a coefficient of $1$ on the $x^2$ term, we’ve got
a coefficient of $-1$. So, the process is identical outside of that so we won’t
put in as much detail this time.

$$ f(x) = -(x^2 - 10x + 1) \text{ } \left(-\frac{10}{2}\right)^2 = (-5)^2 = 25 $$

$$ f(x) = -(x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 + 1) $$

$$ f(x) = -\left((x - 5)^2 - 24\right) $$

$$ f(x) = -(x  - 5)^2 + 24 $$

![Chapter 4.2 Image 14](./4.2_14.png)

For problems 8 - 10 convert the following equations into the form
$y = a(x - h)^2 + k$.

**8.**

$$ f(x) = x^2 - 24x + 157 $$

Take one half of the coefficient of $x$ and square it.

$$ \left(-\frac{24}{2}\right)^2 = (-12)^2 = 144 $$

Then add and subtract this quantity inside our equation.

$$ f(x) = x^2 -24x + 144 - 144 + 157 $$

Now factor the first three terms:

$$ f(x) = (x^2 -24x + 144) - 144 + 157 $$

$$ f(x) = (x - 12)(x - 12) - 144 + 157 $$

$$ f(x) = (x - 12)(x - 12) + 13 $$

And simplify the form:

$$ f(x) = (x - 12)^2 + 13 $$

**9.**

$$ f(x) = 6x^2 + 12x + 3 $$

$$ f(x) = 6\left(x^2 + 2x + \frac{1}{2}\right) $$

should contain the vertex, the $y$-intercept, the $x$-intercepts (if any) and at
least one point on either side of the vertex.

**1.**

$$ f(x) = -4x^2 $$

$$ (0, 0) $$

![Chapter 4.2 Image 15](./4.2_15.png)

**2.**

$$ f(x) = (x - 6)^2 + 1 $$

Find the vertex.

$$ (6, 1) $$

Find the $y$-intercept.

Find the $x$-intercepts (if any).

$$ 0 = (x - 6)^2 + 1 $$

$$ -1 = (x - 6)^2 $$

$$ \pm i = x - 6 $$

$$ 6 \pm i = x $$

Since we cannot have imaginary numbers, there are **no $x$-intercepts**.

Find one point on either side of the vertex.

$$ f(12) = (12 - 6)^2 + 1 $$

$$ f(12) = (6)^2 + 1 $$

$$ f(12) = 36 + 1 $$

$$ f(12) = 37 $$

**3.**

$$ f(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 4 $$

Find the vertex.

$$ (-2, -4) $$

Find the $y$-intercept.

$$ f(0) = (0 + 2)^2 - 4 $$

![Chapter 4.2 Image 17](./4.2_17.png)

**4.**

$$ f(x) = 3(x - 1)^2 + 12 $$

Find the vertex.

$$ (1, 12) $$

Find the $y$-intercept.

$$ f(0) = 3(0 - 1)^2 + 12 $$

$$ f(0) = 3(-1)^2 + 12 $$

$$ f(0) = 3(1) + 12 $$

$$ f(0) = 3 + 12 $$

$$ f(0) = 15 $$

$$ (0, 15) $$

Find the $x$-intercepts (if any).

NOTE: There are likely **no** $x$-intercepts due to the vertex's $y$ index being
positive and $a$ being a positive $3$. But let's solve for it anyway to be sure.

$$ 0 = 3(x - 1)^2 + 12 $$

$$ -12 = 3(x - 1)^2 $$

$$ -4 = (x - 1)^2 $$

$$ \pm \sqrt{-4} = x - 1 $$

$$ 1 \pm 2i = x $$

And already we can see that because we have a **complex** number for our result
in calculating the $x$-intercepts, and **not a real** number, we can therefore
conclude that there are **no $x$-intercepts**.

$$ f(2) = 3(2 - 1)^2 + 12 $$

$$ f(2) = 3(1)^2 + 12 $$

$$ f(2) = 3 + 12 $$

$$ f(2) = 15 $$

$$ (-5, 54) $$

Find the $y$-intercept.

$$ f(0) = -6(0 + 5)^2 + 54 $$

$$ 0 = -6(x + 5)^2 + 54 $$

$$ 0 = -6((x + 5)^2 - 9) $$

$$ 0 = (x + 5)^2 - 9 $$

$$ f(-10) = -150 + 54 $$

**6.**

$$ f(x) = -(x - 7)^2 - 3 $$

Find the vertex.

$$ (7, -3) $$

Find the $y$-intercept.

$$ f(0) = -(0 - 7)^2 - 3 $$

$$ f(0) = -(-7)^2 - 3 $$

$$ f(0) = -(49) - 3 $$

$$ f(0) = -49 - 3 $$

$$ f(0) = -52 $$

$$ (0, -52) $$

Find the $x$-intercepts (if any).

Note: Because the $y$ intercept of the **vertex** is negative, $-3$, and the
value of $a$ is $-1$ in our equation, it is unlikely that we have
$x$-intercepts. Let's see:

$$ 0 = -(x - 7)^2 - 3 $$

$$ 3 = -(x - 7)^2 $$

$$ -3 = (x - 7)^2 $$

$$ \pm \sqrt{-3} = x - 7 $$

$$ 7 \pm \sqrt{3}i = x $$

And as you can see, we have a **complex number** for our $x$-intercepts, which
cannot be. Thusly there are **no $x$-intercepts**.

Find one point on either side of the vertex.

$$ f(14) = -(14 - 7)^2 - 3 $$

$$ f(14) = -(7)^2 - 3 $$

$$ f(14) = -(49) - 3 $$

$$ 3 = (x + 3)^2 $$

$$ \pm \sqrt{3} = x + 3 $$

$$ -3 \pm \sqrt{3} = x $$

**9.**

$$ f(x) = -4x^2 - 1 $$

Find the vertex.

$$ (0, -1) $$

Find the $y$-intercept.

$$ f(0) = -4(0)^2 - 1 $$

$$ f(0) = -4(0) - 1 $$

$$ f(0) = 0 - 1 $$

$$ f(0) = -1 $$

$$ (0, -1) $$

Find the $x$-intercepts (if any).

Note that because the $y$ coordinate of our **vertex** is negative, $-1$, and
the value of $a$ is negative as well $-4$, it is unlikely that we will have any
$x$-intercepts.

$$ 0 = -4x^2 - 1 $$

$$ 1 = -4x^2 $$

$$ -\frac{1}{4} = x^2 $$

$$ \pm \sqrt{-\frac{1}{4}} = x $$

$$ \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}i = x $$

Because our return value for $x$ is a complex number, there are **no
$x$-intercepts**.

$$ f(0) = 0 - 0 + 5 $$

$$ f(0) = 5 $$

$$ (0, 5) $$

Find the $x$-intercepts (if any).

Because the $y$ intercept of our **vertex** is positive, $4$, and the $a$ of our
equation is also positive, $1$. It is unlikely that we'll have any
$x$-intercepts.

$$ 0 = x^2 - 2x + 5 $$

$$ x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} $$

$$ x = \frac{2 \pm 4i}{2} $$

$$ x = 1 \pm 2i $$

As you can see we have a **complex number** returned for $x$, thusly we can
conclude that there are **no $x$-intercepts**.
