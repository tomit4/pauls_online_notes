# 6.5 Applications

---

In this final section of this chapter we need to look at some applications of
exponential and logarithm functions.

**Compound Interest**

This first application is compounding interest and there are actually two
separate formulas that we’ll be looking at here. Let’s first get those out of
the way.

If we were to put $P$ dollars into an account that earns interest at a rate of
$r$ (written as a decimal) for $t$ years (yes, it must be years) then,

1. if interest is compounded $m$ times per year we will have

$$ A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{tm} $$

dollars after $t$ years.

2. if interest is compounded continuously then we will have

$$ A = P\mathbf{e}^{rt} $$

dollars after $t$ years.

Let's take a look at a couple of examples.

---

**Example 1** We are going to invest $100,000 in an account that earns interest
at a rate of 7.5% for 54 months. Determine how much money will be in the account
if,

Before getting into each part let’s identify the quantities that we will need in
all the parts and won’t change.

$$ P = 100,000 \quad r = \frac{7.5}{100} = 0.075 \quad t = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 $$

Remember that interest rates must be decimals for these computations and $t$
must be in years! Now, let’s work the problems.

**(a)** interest is compounded quarterly.

In this part the interest is compounded quarterly and that means it is
compounded 4 times a year. After 54 months we then have,

$$ A = 100000\left(1 + \frac{0.075}{4}\right)^{(4)(4.5)} $$

$$ = 100000(1.01875)^{18} \quad \quad \text{ } $$

$$ = 100000(1.39706686207) $$

$$ = 139706.686207 = \$139,706.69 $$

Notice the amount of decimal places used here. We didn’t do any rounding until
the very last step. It is important to not do too much rounding in intermediate
steps with these problems.

**(b)** interest is compounded monthly.

Here we are compounding monthly and so that means we are compounding 12 times a
year. Here is how much we’ll have after 54 months.

$$ A = 100000\left(1 + \frac{0.075}{12} \right)^{(12)(4.5)} $$

$$ = 100000(1.00625)^{54} \quad \quad \text{ } \text{ } \text{ } $$

$$ = 139996.843023 = \$139,996.84 $$

So, compounding more times per year will yield more money.

**(c\)** interest is compounded continuously.

Finally, if we compound continuously then after 54 months we will have,

$$ A = 100000\mathbf{e}^{(0.075)(4.5)} $$

$$ \quad \quad \quad \quad = 100000(1.40143960839) $$

$$ \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad = 140143.960839 = \$140,143.96 $$

---

Now, as pointed out in the first part of this example it is important to not
round too much before the final answer. Let’s go back and work the first part
again and this time let’s round to three decimal places at each step.

$$ A = 100000\left(1 + \frac{0.075}{4} \right)^{(4)(4.5)} $$

$$ = 100000(1.019)^{18} \quad \quad \quad \text{ } $$

$$ = 100000(1.403) \quad \quad \quad \quad  $$

$$ = \$140,300.00 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad $$

This answer is off from the correct answer by $593.31 and that’s a fairly large
difference. So, how many decimal places should we keep in these? Well,
unfortunately the answer is that it depends. The larger the initial amount the
more decimal places we will need to keep around. As a general rule of thumb, set
your calculator to the maximum number of decimal places it can handle and take
all of them until the final answer and then round at that point.

Let’s now look at a different kind of example with compounding interest.

---

**Example 2** We are going to put $2500 into an account that earns interest at a
rate of 12%. If we want to have $4000 in the account when we close it how long
should we keep the money in the account if,

Again, let's identify the quantities that won't change with each part.

$$ A = 4000 \quad P = 2500 \quad r = \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 $$

Notice that this time we've been given $A$ and are asking to find $t$. This
means that we are going to have to solve an exponential equation to get at the
answer.

**(a)** we compound interest continously.

Let's first set up the equation that we'll need to solve.

$$ 4000 = 2500\mathbf{e}^{0.12t} $$

Now, we saw how to solve these kinds of equations a couple of
[**sections ago**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveExpEqns.aspx).
In that section we saw that we need to get the exponential on one side by itself
with a coefficient of 1 and then take the natural logarithm of both sides. Let's
do that.

$$ \frac{4000}{2500} = \mathbf{e}^{0.12t} $$

$$ \quad 1.6 = \mathbf{e}^{0.12t} $$

$$ \quad \ln{1.6} = \ln{\mathbf{e}^{0.12t}} $$

$$ \hspace{11.5em} \ln{1.6} = 0.12t \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{\ln{1.6}}{0.12} = 3.917 $$

We need to keep the amount in the account for 3.917 years to get $4000.

**(b)** we compound interest 6 times a year.

Again, let's first set up the equation that we need to solve.

$$ 4000 = 2500\left(1 + \frac{0.12}{6} \right)^{6t} $$

$$ 4000 = 2500(1.02)^{6t} \hspace{2.8em} $$

We will solve this the same way that we solved the previous part. The work will
be a little messier, but for the most part it will be the same.

$$ \frac{4000}{2500} = (1.02)^{6t} $$

$$ \quad 1.6 = (1.02)^{6t} $$

$$ \quad \ln{1.6} = \ln{(1.02)^{6t}} $$

$$ \hspace{1.5em} \ln{1.6} = 6t\ln{(1.02)} $$

$$ \hspace{5.3em} t = \frac{\ln{1.6}}{6\ln{(1.02)}} = \frac{0.470003629246}{6(0.019802627296)} = 3.956 $$

In this case we need to keep the amount slightly longer to reach $4000.

**Exponential Growth and Decay**

There are many quantities out there in the world that are governed (at least for
a short time period) by the equation,

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{kt} $$

where $Q_0$ is positive and is the amount initially present at $t = 0$ and $k$
is a non-zero constant. If $k$ is positive then the equation will grow without
bound and is called the **exponential growth** equation. Likewise, if $k$ is
negative the equation will die down to zero and is called the **exponential
decay** equation.

Short term population growth is often modeled by the exponential growth equation
and the decay of a radioactive element is governed the exponential decay
equation.

---

**Example 3** The growth of a colony of bacteria is given by the equation,

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{0.195t} $$

If there are initially 500 bacteria present and $t$ is given in hours determine
each of the following.

Here is the equation for this starting amount of bacteria.

$$ Q = 500\mathbf{e}^{0.195t} $$

**(a)** How many bacteria are there after a half of a day?

In this case if we want the number of bacteria after half of a day we will need
to use $t = 12$ since $t$ is in hours. So, to get the answer to this part we
just need to plug $t$ into the equation.

$$ Q = 500\mathbf{e}^{0.195(12)} = 500(10.3812365627) = 5190.618 $$

So, since a fractional population doesn't make much sense we'll say that after
half of a day there are 5190 of the bacteria present.

**(b)** How long will it take before there are 10000 bacteria in the colony?

Do NOT make the mistake of assuming that it will be approximately 1 day for this
answer based on the answer to the previous part. With exponential growth things
just don't work that way as we'll see. In order to answer this part we will need
to solve the following exponential equation.

$$ 10000 = 500\mathbf{e}^{0.195t} $$

Let's do that.

$$ \frac{10000}{500} = \mathbf{e}^{0.195t} $$

$$ \hspace{2em} 20 = \mathbf{e}^{0.195t} $$

$$ \hspace{2em} \ln{20} = \ln{\mathbf{e}^{0.195t}} $$

$$ \hspace{13.6em} \ln{20} = 0.195t \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{\ln{20}}{0.195} = 15.3627 $$

So, it only takes approximately 15.4 hours to reach 10000 bacteria and NOT 24
hours if we just double the time from the first part. In other words, be
careful!

---

**Example 4** Carbon 14 dating works by measuring the amount of Carbon 14 (a
radioactive element) that is in a fossil. All living things have a constant
level of Carbon 14 in them and once they die it starts to decay according to the
formula,

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{-0.000124t} $$

where $t$ is in years and $Q_0$ is the amount of Carbon 14 present at death and
for this example let's assume that there will be 100 milligrams present at
death.

**(a)** How much Carbon 14 will there be after 1000 years?

In this case all we need to do is plug in $t = 1000$ into the equation.

$$ Q = 100\mathbf{e}^{-0.000124(1000)} = 100(0.883379840883) = 88.338 \text{ milligrams} $$

So, it looks like we will have around 88.338 milligrams left after 1000 years.

**(b)** How long will it take for half of the Carbon 14 to decay?

So, we want to know how long it will take until there is 50 milligrams of the
Carbon 14 left. That means we will have to solve the following equation,

$$ 50 = 100\mathbf{e}^{-0.000124t} $$

Here is that work.

$$ \frac{50}{100} = \mathbf{e}^{-0.000124t} $$

$$ \quad \frac{1}{2} = \mathbf{e}^{-0.000124t} $$

$$ \quad \ln{\frac{1}{2}} = \ln{\mathbf{e}^{-0.000124t}} $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{\frac{1}{2}}}{-0.000124} = \frac{-0.69314718056}{-0.000124} = 5589.89661742 $$

So, it looks like it will take about 5589.897 years for half of the Carbon 14 to
decay. This number is called the **half-life** of Carbon 14.

We’ve now looked at a couple of applications of exponential equations and we
should now look at a quick application of a logarithm.

**Earthquake Intensity**

The **Richter scale** is commonly used to measure the intensity of an
earthquake. There are many different ways of computing this based on a variety
of different quantities. We are going to take a quick look at the formula that
uses the energy released during an earthquake.

If $E$ is the energy released, measured in joules, during an earthquake then the
magnitude of the earthquake is given by,

$$ M = \frac{2}{3}\log{\left(\frac{E}{E_0}\right)} $$

where $E_0 = 10^{4.4}$ joules.

---

**Example 5** If $8 \times 10^{14}$ joules of energy is released during an
earthquake what was the magnitude of the earthquake?

There really isn't much to do here other than to plug into the formula.

$$ M = \frac{2}{3}\log{\left(\frac{8 \times 10^{14}}{10^{4.4}}\right)} = \frac{2}{3}\log{(8 \times 10^{9.6})} = \frac{2}{3}(10.50308999) = 7.002 $$

So, it looks like we'll have a magnitude of about 7.

---

**Example 6** How much energy will be released in an earthquake with a magnitude
of 5.9?

In this case we will need to solve the following equation.

$$ 5.9 = \frac{2}{3}\log{\left(\frac{E}{10^{4.4}}\right)} $$

We saw how to solve these kinds of equations in the previous
[**section**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveLogEqns.aspx).
First we need the logarithm on one side by itself with a coefficient of one.
Once we have it in that form we convert to exponential form and solve.

$$ 5.9 = \frac{2}{3}\log{\left(\frac{E}{10^{4.4}}\right)} $$

$$ 8.85 = \log{\left(\frac{E}{10^{4.4}}\right)} $$

$$ 10^{8.85} = \frac{E}{10^{4.4}} $$

$$ E = 10^{8.85}(10^{4.4}) = 10^{13.25} $$

So, it looks like there would be a release of $10^{13.25}$ joules of energy in
an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9.

## Practice Problems

**1.** We have $10,000 to invest for 44 months. How much money will we have if
we put the money into an account that has an annual interest rate of 5.5% and
interest is compounded

$$ A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{tm} $$

$$ A = P\mathbf{e}^{rt} $$

$$ P = 10000 \quad r = \frac{12}{100} = 0.055 \quad t = \frac{44}{12} = 3.666666667 $$

**(a)** quarterly

$$ m = 4 $$

$$ A = 10000\left(1 + \frac{0.055}{4}\right)^{(3.666666667)(4)} $$

$$ A = 10000(1.01375)^{(3.666666667)(4)} $$

$$ A = 10000(1.221760422) = 12217.60422 $$

$$ \boxed{\$12,217.60} $$

**(b)** monthly

$$ m = 12 $$

$$ A = 10000\left(1 + \frac{0.055}{12}\right)^{(3.666666667)(12)} $$

$$ A = 10000(1.004583333)^{(3.666666667)(12)} $$

$$ A = 10000(1.222876544) $$

$$ A = 12228.76544 $$

$$ \boxed{\$12,228.77} $$

**(c\)** continuously

$$ A = P\mathbf{e}^{rt} $$

$$ A = 10000\mathbf{e}^{(0.055)(3.666666667)} $$

$$ A = 10000(1.223440127) $$

$$ A = 12234.40127 $$

$$ \boxed{\$12,234.40} $$

**2.** We are starting with $5000 and we're going to put it into an account that
earns an annual interest rate of 12%. How long should we leave the money in the
account in order to double our money if interest is compounded

$$ A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{tm} $$

$$ A = P\mathbf{e}^{rt} $$

$$ A = 10000 \quad P = 5000 \quad r = \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 $$

**(a)** quarterly

$$ m = 4 $$

$$ 10000 = 5000\left(1 + \frac{0.12}{4}\right)^{4t} $$

$$ 2 = 1.03^{4t} $$

$$ \ln{2} = \ln{(1.03)}^{4t} $$

$$ \ln{2} = 4t\ln{(1.03)} $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{(2)}}{4\ln{(1.03)}} = 5.862443063  $$

We'll double our money in approximately $\boxed{5.8624} \text{ years}$.

**(b)** monthly

$$ m = 12 $$

$$ 10000 = 5000\left(1 + \frac{0.12}{12}\right)^{12t} $$

$$ 2 = (1.01)^{12t} $$

$$ \ln{2} = \ln{(1.01)}^{12t} $$

$$ \ln{2} = 12t\ln{(1.01)} $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{(2)}}{12\ln{(1.01)}} = 5.805059741 $$

We'll double our money in approximately $\boxed{5.8051} \text{ years}$.

**(c\)** continuously

$$ 10000 = 5000\mathbf{e}^{0.12t} $$

$$ 2 = \mathbf{e}^{0.12t} $$

$$ \ln{2} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{0.12t} $$

$$ \ln{2} = 0.12t\ln{\mathbf{e}} $$

$$ \ln{2} = 0.12t $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{(2)}}{0.12} = 5.776226505 $$

We'll double our money in approximately $\boxed{5.7762} \text{ years}$.

**3.** A population of bacteria initially has 250 present and in 5 days there
will be 1600 bacteria present.

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{kt} $$

1. Determine the exponential growth equation for this population.

$$ Q = 1600 \quad Q_0 = 250 \quad t = 5 \quad k = \text{?} $$

$$ 1600 = 250\mathbf{e}^{5k} $$

$$ \frac{1600}{250} = \mathbf{e}^{5k} $$

$$ \ln{\frac{32}{5}}= \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{5k} $$

$$ \ln{\frac{32}{5}}= 5k\ln{\mathbf{e}}$$

$$ k = \frac{1}{5}\ln{\left(\frac{32}{5}\right)} = 0.3712595981 $$

$$ \boxed{Q = 250\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{5}\ln\left(\frac{32}{5}\right)t}} $$

2. How long will it take for the population to grow from its initial population
   of 250 to a population of 2000?

$$ 2000 = 250\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{5}\ln\left(\frac{32}{5}\right)t} $$

$$ 8 = \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{5}\ln\left(\frac{32}{5}\right)t} $$

$$ \ln{8} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{\frac{1}{5}\ln\left(\frac{32}{5}\right)t} $$

$$ \ln{8} = \frac{1}{5}\ln\left(\frac{32}{5}\right)t $$

$$ t = \frac{5\ln{8}}{\ln{\left(\dfrac{32}{5}\right)}} = 5.601044532 $$

The time it will take is approximately $\boxed{5.601 \text{ days}}$ for the
population to reach $2000$.

**4.** We initially have 100 grams of a radioactive element and in 1250 years
there will be 80 grams left.

1. Determine the exponential decay equation for this element.

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{kt} $$

$$ Q_0 = 100 \quad Q = 80 \quad t = 1250 $$

$$ 80 = 100\mathbf{e}^{1250k} $$

$$ \frac{4}{5} = \mathbf{e}^{1250k} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{1250k} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)} = 1250k $$

$$ k = \frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\dfrac{4}{5}\right)} = -0.0001785148411 $$

$$ Q = 100\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}} $$

2. How long will it take for half of the element to decay?

$$ Q = 50 $$

$$ 50 = 100\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}} $$

$$ \frac{1}{2} = \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}}  $$

$$ \ln{\frac{1}{2}} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{\frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}}  $$

$$ \ln{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t} $$

$$ t = \frac{1250\ln{\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)}}{\ln{\left(\dfrac{4}{5}\right)}} = 3882.854649 $$

The half-life of the element is approximately
$\boxed{3,882.8546 \text{ years}}$.

3. How long will it take until there is only 1 gram of the element left?

$$ Q = 1 $$

$$ 1 = 100\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}} $$

$$ \frac{1}{100} = \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}}  $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{\frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}}  $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)} = \frac{1}{1250}\ln{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t}$$

$$ t = \frac{1250\ln{\left(\dfrac{1}{100}\right)}}{\ln{\left(\dfrac{4}{5}\right)}} = 25797.12790 $$

The time it will take until the element decays until there is only
$1 \text{ gram}$ left is approximately $\boxed{25,797.1279 \text{ years}}$.

## Assignment Problems

**1.** We have $2,500 to invest and 80 months. How much money will we have if we
put the money into an account that has an annual interest rate of 9% and
interest is compounded

$$ A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{tm} $$

$$ A = P\mathbf{e}^{rt} $$

$$ P = 2500 \quad r = \frac{9}{100} = 0.09 \quad t = \frac{80}{12} = 6.666666667 $$

**(a)** quarterly

$$ m = 4 $$

$$ A = 2500\left(1 + \frac{0.09}{4}\right)^{(6.666666667)(4)} $$

$$ A = 2500(1.0225)^{26.66666667} $$

$$ A = 2500(1.810041135) $$

$$ A = 4525.102838 $$

If compounded **quarterly**, we will have approximately
$\$4,525.10 \text{ dollars}$ after $80 \text{ months}$ at a
$9\% \text{ interest rate}$.

**(b)** monthly

$$ m = 12 $$

$$ A = 2500\left(1 + \frac{0.09}{12}\right)^{(6.666666667)(12)} $$

$$ A = 2500(1.0075)^{80} $$

$$ A = 2500(1.818043980) $$

$$ A = 4545.10995$$

If compounded **monthly**, we will have approximately
$\$4,545.11 \text{ dollars}$ after $80 \text{ months}$ at a
$9\% \text{ interest rate}$.

**(c\)** continuously

$$ A = 2500\mathbf{e}^{(0.09)(6.666666667)} $$

$$ A = 2500\mathbf{e}^{0.6} $$

$$ A = 4555.297001 $$

If compounded **continuously**, we will have approximately
$\$4,555.30 \text{ dollars}$ after $80 \text{ months}$ at a
$9\% \text{ interest rate}$.

**2.** We are starting with $60,000 and we're going to put it into an account
that earns an annual interest rate of 7.5%. How long will it take for the money
in the account to reach $100,000 if the interest is compounded

$$ A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{tm} $$

$$ A = P\mathbf{e}^{rt} $$

$$ P = 60000 \quad r = \frac{7.5}{100} = 0.075 \quad A = 100000 $$

**(a)** quarterly

$$ m = 4 $$

$$ 100000 = 60000\left(1 + \frac{0.075}{4}\right)^{4t} $$

$$ \frac{5}{3} = (1.01875)^{4t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = \ln{(1.01875)}^{4t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = 4t\ln{(1.01875)} $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{\left(\dfrac{5}{3}\right)}}{4\ln(1.01875)} = 6.874663827 $$

Compounded **quarterly**, at an annual interest rate of $7.5\%$, starting at
$\$60,000$, our account will have reached $\$100,000$ in approximately
$\boxed{6.8747 \text{ years}}$.

**(b)** monthly

$$ m = 12 $$

$$ 100000 = 60000\left(1 + \frac{0.075}{12}\right)^{12t} $$

$$ \frac{5}{3} = (1.00625)^{12t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = \ln{(1.00625)}^{12t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = 12t\ln{(1.00625)} $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{\left(\dfrac{5}{3}\right)}}{12\ln{(1.00625)}} = 6.832270616 $$

Compounded **monthly**, at an annual interest rate of $7.5\%$, starting at
$\$60,000$, our account will have reached $\$100,000$ in approximately
$\boxed{6.8323 \text{ years}}$.

**(c\)** continuously

$$ 100000 = 60000\mathbf{e}^{0.075t} $$

$$ \frac{5}{3} = \mathbf{e}^{0.075t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{0.075t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = 0.075t$$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{\left(\dfrac{5}{3}\right)}}{0.075} = 6.811008317 $$

Compounded **continuously**, at an annual interest rate of $7.5\%$, starting at
$\$60,000$, our account will have reached $\$100,000$ in approximately
$\boxed{6.811 \text{ years}}$.

**3.** Suppose that we put some money in an account that has an annual interest
rate of 10.25%. How long will it take to triple our money if the interest is
compounded

$$ A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{tm} $$

$$ A = P\mathbf{e}^{rt} $$

$$ r = \frac{10.25}{100} = 0.1025  $$

**(a)** twice a year

$$ m = 2 $$

$$ 3P = P\left(1 + \frac{0.1025}{2}\right)^{2t} $$

$$ 3 = (1.05125)^{2t} $$

$$ \ln{3} = \ln{(1.05125)}^{2t} $$

$$ \ln{3} = 2t\ln{(1.05125)} $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{(3)}}{2\ln{(1.05125)}} = 10.99053398 $$

At an annual interest rate of $10.25\%$, compounded at **twice per year**, we
will triple some amount of money in approximately
$\boxed{10.9905 \text{ years}}$.

**(b)** 8 times a year

$$ m = 8 $$

$$ 3P = P\left(1 + \frac{0.1025}{8}\right)^{8t} $$

$$ 3 = (1.0128125)^{8t} $$

$$ \ln{3} = \ln{(1.0128125)}^{8t} $$

$$ \ln{3} = 8t\ln{(1.0128125)} $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{(3)}}{8\ln{(1.0128125)}} = 10.78668625 $$

At an annual interest rate of $10.25\%$, compounded at **8 times per year**, we
will triple some amount of money in approximately
$\boxed{10.7867 \text{ years}}$.

**(c\)** continuously

$$ 3P = P\mathbf{e}^{0.1025t} $$

$$ 3 = \mathbf{e}^{0.1025t} $$

$$ \ln{3} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{0.1025t} $$

$$ \ln{3} = 0.1025t $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{3}}{0.1025} = 10.71816867 $$

At an annual interest rate of $10.25\%$, compounded at **continuously**, we will
triple some amount of money in approximately $\boxed{10.7182 \text{ years}}$.

**4.** A population of bacteria initially has 90,000 present and in 2 weeks
there will be 200,000 bacteria present.

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{kt} $$

$$ Q_0 = 90000 \quad Q = 200000 t = 2 $$

1. Determine the exponential growth equation for this population.

$$ 200000 = 90000\mathbf{e}^{2k} $$

$$ \frac{20}{9} = \mathbf{e}^{2k} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{2k} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)} = 2k $$

$$ k = \frac{1}{2}\ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)} = 0.3992538481 $$

$$ Q = 90000\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}\ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)t}} $$

2. How long will it take for the population to grow from its initial population
   of 90,000 to a population of 150,000?

$$ 150000 = 90000\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}\ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)t}} $$

$$ \frac{5}{3} = \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}\ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)t}} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{\frac{1}{2}\ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)t}} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)} = \frac{1}{2}\ln{\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)t} $$

$$ t = \frac{2\ln{\left(\dfrac{5}{3}\right)}}{\ln{\left(\dfrac{20}{9}\right)}} = 1.279450721 $$

It will take approximately $\boxed{1.2795 \text{ weeks}}$ for the population of
bacteria to grow from its initial population of 90,000 to a population of
150,000.

**5.** We initially have 2kg grams of some radioactive element and in 7250 years
there will be 1.5kg left.

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{kt} $$

$$ t = 7250 \quad Q_0 = 2 \quad Q = 1.5 $$

1. Determine the exponential decay equation for this element.

$$ 1.5 = 2\mathbf{e}^{7250t} $$

$$ 0.75 = \mathbf{e}^{7250t} $$

$$ \ln{0.75} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{7250t} $$

$$ \ln{0.75} = 7250t $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{(0.75)}}{7250} = -0.00003968028586 $$

$$ Q = 2\mathbf{e}^{-0.00003968028586t} $$

2. How long will it take for half of the element to decay?

$$ 1 = 2\mathbf{e}^{-0.00003968028586t} $$

$$ \frac{1}{2} = \mathbf{e}^{-0.00003968028586t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{-0.00003968028586t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = -0.00003968028586t $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)}}{-0.00003968028586} = 17468.30109 $$

With an initial amount of 2 kg grams of the eleement, it will take approximately
$\boxed{17,468.3011 \text{ years}}$ for half of the element to decay.

3. How long will it take until there is 250 grams of the element left?

$$ 0.25 = 2\mathbf{e}^{-0.00003968028586t} $$

$$ 0.125 = \mathbf{e}^{-0.00003968028586t} $$

$$ \ln{0.125} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{-0.00003968028586t} $$

$$ \ln{0.125} = -0.00003968028586t $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{0.125}}{-0.00003968028586} = 52404.90326 $$

With an initial amount of 2 kg grams of the eleement, it will take approximately
$\boxed{52,404.9033 \text{ years}}$ for 250g of the element to be left.

**6.** For a particular radioactive element the value of k in the exponential
decay equation is given by $k = -0.000825$.

$$ Q = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{kt} $$

$$ k = -0.000825 $$

1. How long will it take for a quarter of the element to decay?

$$ \frac{3}{4}Q_0 = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \frac{3}{4} = \mathbf{e}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} = -0.000825t $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{\left(\dfrac{3}{4}\right)}}{-0.000825} = 348.7055424 $$

For a particular radioactive element where $k$ in the exponential decay equation
is given by $k = -0.000825$, it will take approximately
$348.7055424 \text{ years}$ for a **quarter** of the element to decay.

2. How long will it take for half of the element to decay?

$$ \frac{1}{2}Q_0 = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \frac{1}{2} = \mathbf{e}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = -0.000825t $$

$$ t =  \frac{\ln{\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)}}{-0.000825} = 840.1784007 $$

For a particular radioactive element where $k$ in the exponential decay equation
is given by $k = -0.000825$, it will take approximately $840.1784 \text{ years}$
for a **half** of the element to decay.

3. How long will it take 90% of the element to decay?

$$ \frac{1}{10}Q_0 = Q_0\mathbf{e}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \frac{1}{10} = \mathbf{e}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)} = \ln{\mathbf{e}}^{-0.000825t} $$

$$ \ln{\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)} = -0.000825t $$

$$ t = \frac{\ln{\left(\dfrac{1}{10}\right)}}{-0.000825} = 2791.012234 $$

For a particular radioactive element where $k$ in the exponential decay equation
is given by $k = -0.000825$, it will take approximately
$2,791.0122 \text{ years}$ for a **90%** of the element to decay.
