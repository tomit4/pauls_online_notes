**Example 1**

> In a certain Algebra class there is a total of 350 possible points. These
> points come from 5 homework sets that are worth 10 points each and 3 hour
> exams that are worth 100 points each. A student has received homework scores
> of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 and the first two exam scores are 78 and 83. Assuming
> that grades are ssigned according to the standard scale and there are no
> weights assigned to any of the grades is it possible for the student to
> receive an A in the class and if so what is the minimum score on the third
> exame that will give an A? What about a B?

$$ \text{POSSIBLE POINTS} = 350 $$

$$ \text{NUMBER OF HOMEWORK SETS} = 5 $$

$$ \text{POINTS PER HOMEWORK SET} = 10 $$

$$ \text{NUMBER OF HOUR EXAMS} = 3 $$

$$ \text{POINTS PER HOUR EXAM} = 100 $$

$$ \text{STUDENT'S HOMEWORK SCORES} = \{4, 8, 7 ,7, 9\}$$

$$ \text{EXAM SCORES} = \{78, 83\} $$

$$ \text{IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A STUDENT TO RECEIVE AN A IN THE CLASS?} =
\text{TRUE/FALSE} $$

$$ \text{IF GETTING AN A IS POSSIBLE, WHAT IS THE MIN SCORE ON THIRD EXAM TO GET
A?} = ? $$

$$ \text{WHAT ABOUT A B?} = ? $$

**Solution**

$$ \frac{4 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 9 + 78 + 83 + x}{350} >= \frac{90}{100} $$

$$ \frac{196 + x}{350} >= \frac{90}{100} $$

**1.**

Is it possible for a student to receive an A in the class?

Let's break this down. The formula for determining the minimum score required to
get an A in the class is:

$$ \frac{196 + x}{350} = \frac{90}{100} $$

Where $196$ represents our total points thus far, $x$ represents the score
needed to get a 90% in our class, and $350$ represents the total possible
points. Let's solve for $x$:

$$ \frac{196 + x}{350} = \frac{90}{100} $$

$$ (350)(\frac{196 + x}{350}) = (\frac{90}{100})350 $$

$$ 196 + x = 315 $$

$$ x = 119 $$

But this exceeds the total possible number of points one can get on a single
test as established in the problem statement (100). Thusly it is not possible to
get an A in the class.

A: No.

**2.**

What about a B?

We can determine the final test score needed to at least get a B in the class
using the same formula, but adjusting the score needed in the formula:

$$ \frac{196 + x}{350} = \frac{80}{100} $$

Once again, let's solve for $x$:

$$ \frac{196 + x}{350} = \frac{80}{100} $$

$$ (350)(\frac{196 + x}{350}) = (\frac{80}{100})(350) $$

$$ 196 + x = 280 $$

$$ x = 84 $$

This is below the possible test score of 100, so this is a possible grade the
student could receive on the test, and thusly 84 would be the bare minimum grade
necessary for the studen to pass the class with a B.

A: Yes, it is possible for the student to get a B in the class. They would need
to score at least an 84% on the last exam to get a 80% in the whole class
(leaving them with a B-).

**Example 2**

> We want to build a set of shelves. The width of the set of shelves needs to be
> 4 times th eheight of the set of shelves and the set of shelves must have
> three shelves in it. If there are 72 feet of wood to use to build the set of
> shelves what should the dimension fo the set of shelves be?

$$ \text{HEIGHT} = \text{HEIGHT} $$

$$ \text{WIDTH} = 4 \cdot \text{HEIGHT} $$

$$ \text{REQUIRED NUMBER OF SHELVES} = 3 $$

$$ \text{AMOUNT OF WOOD TO BUILD SHELVES} = 72\text{ft.} $$

We know that a shelf, being a rectanglular object with 4 vertical pieces, and do
to the constraints of the problem statement, requires 2 horizontal pieces(2
pieces to create 3 shelves). We can also assume that we are using up all
$72\text{ft.}$ of the wood. Thusly our problem can be expressed by the following
equation:

$$ 4(4x) + 2(x) = 72 $$

$$ 16x + 2x = 72 $$

$$ 18x = 72 $$

$$ x = 4 $$

This gives us the height of the shelves, but we also need to giev the dimensions
as per the problem statment, since our height is $4$, and we know width is $4
\cdot \text{HEIGHT}$, then we can easily determine our width is $16$.

So our final dimensions we will need are $4x16 \text{ft.}$

**Example 3**

> A calculator has been marked up 15% and is being sold for $78.50. How much did
> the store pay the manufacturer of the calculator?

$$ 1.15x = 78.50 $$

Where $x$ represents the cost paid by the store prior to the 15% markup.

$$ 1.15x = 78.50 $$

$$ \frac{1.15x}{1.15} = \frac{78.50}{1.15} $$

$$ x = 68.26 $$

So the store paid $68.26 to the manufacturer.

---

**Example 4**

A shirt is on sale for $15.00 and has been marked down 35%. How much was the
shirt being sold for before the sale?

This means that the shirt is currently selling for 65% of its original price.
Because of this, we can use the following formula to determine the original
price of the shirt:

$$ 0.65x = 15 $$

Where $x$ represents the original price of the shirt.

$$ \frac{0.65x}{0.65} = \frac{15}{0.65} $$

$$ x = 23.08 $$

Thusly the original price of the shirt was $23.08.

$$ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} $$

**Example 5**

Two cars are 500 miles apart and moving directly towards each other. One car is
moving at a speed of 100 mph and the other is moving at 70 mph. Assuming that
the cars start m oving at the same time how long does it take for the two cars
to meet?

Every hour each car moves their respective distances towards each other (100mph
for car A, 70mph for car B), closing the 500 mile gap. We want to grab the total
hours when the total gap of 500 is traversed. This can be expressed as:

$$ (\text{DISTANCE OF CAR A}) + (\text{DISTANCE OF CAR B}) = 500 $$

Or also as:

$$ (\text{RATE OF CAR A})(\text{TIME OF CAR A}) + (\text{RATE OF CAR B})(\text{TIME OF CAR B}) = 500 $$

Since we know the Rate for both cars, we simply have to create a variable for
the total time, $t$ and find it using the above formula:

$$ 100t + 70t = 500 $$

$$ 170t = 500 $$

$$ \frac{170t}{170} = \frac{500}{170} $$

$$ t = 2.941176 \text{hours} $$

Thusly, both cars will travel about $2.94$ hours before meeting.

---

**Example 6**

Repeat the previous example except this time assume that the faster car will
start 1 hour after the slower car starts.

This is simple. we simply adjust the $t$ variable for Car A by subtracting 1
from it like so:

$$ 100(t - 1) + 70t = 500 $$

$$ 100t - 100 + 70t = 500 $$

$$ 100t + 70t = 600 $$

$$ 170t = 600 $$

$$ \frac{170t}{170} = \frac{600}{170} $$

$$ t = 3.529411 \text{hours} $$

Thusly, the faster car wil travel about $3.53$ hours before meeting. Whilst the
slower car wil ltravel $2.53$ hours before meeting (1 hour less since it started
1 hour earlier).

**Example 7**

Two boats start out 100 miles apart and start moving to the right at the same
time. The boat on the left is moving at twice the speed as the boat on the
right. Five hours after starting the boat on the left catches up with the boat
on the right. How fast was each boat moving?

$$ \text{RIGHT BOAT SPEED} = r $$

$$ \text{LEFT BOAT SPEED} = 2r $$

We can find the speed of each boat by taking the total hours when they meet, $5$
and multiplying it by each respective rate. Since the right most boat is $100$
miles ahead, we can also add that to the side of the equation representing the
right most boat. By solving for the rate, we can determine the speed of each
boat:

$$ 100 + (r)(5) = (2r)(5) $$

$$ 100 + 5r = 10r $$

$$ 100 = 5r $$

$$ \frac{100}{5} = \frac{5r}{5} $$

$$ 20 = r $$

Thusly the speed of our RIGHT BOAT is $20 \text{mph}$, and the speed of our LEFT
BOAT is $40 \text{mph}$.

$$ (\text{Portion of job done in given time}) = (\text{Work Rate}) \times
(\text{Time Spent Working}) $$

**Example 8**

An office has two envelope stuffing machines. Machine A can stuff a batch of
envelopes in 5 hours, while Machine B can stuff a batch of envelopes in 3 hours.
How long would it take the two machines working together to stuff a batch of
envelopes?

In a single hour, Machine A can get $\frac{1}{5}$ of a batch done. In a single
hour, Machine B can get $\frac{1}{3}$ of a batch done.

Machine A's work can be represented as such:

$$ 1\text{BATCH} = (\frac{1}{5}\text{BATCH PER HOUR}) \times (5\text{HOURS})$$

Similarly, Machine B's work can be represented as such:

$$ 1\text{BATCH} = (\frac{1}{3}\text{BATCH PER HOUR}) \times (3\text{HOURS})$$

We are now combining their two formulas together, but solving for the total
amount of HOURS, $h$:

$$ 1 = (\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5}) \times h $$

$$ 1 = \frac{8}{15}h $$

$$ 15 = 8h $$

$$ \frac{15}{8} = h $$

$$ 1.875 = h $$

Thusly it would take both machines $1.875\text{hours}$ to stuff a single batch
of envelopes.

**Example 9**

Mary can clean an office complex in 5 hours. Working together John and Mary can
clean the office complex in 3.5 hours. How lng would it take John to clean the
office complex by himself?

This is similar to the previous problem, but we are trying to parse out how long
it will take a single entity to do the job.

$$ 1 = (\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{x}) \ times 3.5 $$

$$ 1 = 3.5(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{x}) $$

$$ 1 = 0.7 + \frac{3.5}{x} $$

$$ 0.3 = \frac{3.5}{x} $$

$$ 0.3x = 3.5 $$

$$ x \approx 11.67 $$

It will take John about 11.67 hours to clean the complex by himself.

$$ (\text{Amount of secondary liquid in the water}) = (\text{Percentage of Solution}) \times (\text{Volume of Solution}) $$

** Example 10**

How much of a 50% alcohol solution should we mix with 10 gallons of a 35%
solution to get a 40% solution?

$$ (\text{Amount of alcohol in 50\% solution}) + (\text{Amount of alcohol in 35\% solution}) = (\text{Amount of alcohol in 40\% solution})$$

$$ (0.5)(\text{Volume of 50\% Solution}) + (0.35)(\text{Volume of 35\% Solution}) = (0.4)(\text{Volume of 40\% Solution}) $$

$$ 0.5x + 0.35(10) = 0.4(x + 10) $$

$$ 0.5x + 3.5 = 0.4x + 4 $$

$$ 0.1x = 0.5 $$

$$ x = \frac{0.5}{0.1} = 5\text{ gallons} $$

Thusly, we need 5 gallons of the 50% solution to get a 40% solution.

---

**Example 11**

We have a 40% acid solution and we want 75 liters of a 15% acid solution. How
much water should we put into the 40% solution to do this?

$$ 0(x) + 0.4(75 - x) = 0.15(75) $$

$$ 30 - 0.4x = 11.25 $$

$$ 18.75 = 0.4x $$

$$ x = \frac{18.75}{0.4} = 46.875\text{ liters} $$

Thusly we need to add 46.875 liters of water to 28.125 liters of a 40% solution
to get 75 liters of a 15% solution.
