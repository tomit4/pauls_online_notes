# Section 4.11 : Linear Approximations

In this section we're going to take a look at an application not of derivatives
but of the tangent line to a function. Of course, to get the tangent line we do
need to take derivatives, so in some way this is an application of derivatives
as well.

Given a function, $f(x)$, we can find its tangent at $x = a$. The equation of
the tangent line, which we'll call $L(x)$ for this discussion, is,

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

Take a look at the following graph of a function and its tangent line.

![image 4.11_1](./4.11_1.png)

From this graph we can see that near $x = a$ the tangent line and the function
have nearly the same graph. On occassion we will use the tangent line, $L(x)$,
as an approximation to the function, $f(x)$, near $x = a$. In these cases we
call the tangent line the **linear approximation** to teh function at $x = a$.

So, why would we do this? Let's take a look at an example.

---

**Example 1** Determine the linear approximation for $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$ at
$x = 8$. Use the linear approximation to approximate the value of
$\sqrt[3]{8.05}$ and $\sqrt[3]{25}$.

**Solution**

Since this is just the tangent line there really isn't a whole lot to finding
the linear approximation.

$$ f'(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^{-\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \quad \quad f(8) = 2 \quad \quad f'(8) = \frac{1}{12} $$

The linear approximation is then,

$$  L(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{12}(x - 8) = \frac{1}{12}x + \frac{4}{3} $$

Now, the approximations are nothing more than plugging the given values of $x$
into the linear approximation. For comparison purposes we'll also compute the
exact values.

$$ L(8.05) = 2.00416667 \quad \quad \quad \sqrt[3]{8.05} = 2.00415802 $$

$$ L(25) = 3.41666667 \quad \quad \quad \sqrt[3]{25} = 2.92401774 $$

So, at $x = 8.05$ this linear approximation does a very good job of
approximating the actual value. However, at $x = 25$ it doesn't do such a good
job.

This shouldn't be too surprising if you think about it. Near $x = 8$ both the
function and the linear approximation have nearly the same slope and since they
both pass through the point $(8, 2)$ they should have nearly the same value as
long as we stay close to $x = 8$. However, as we move away from $x = 8$ the
linear approximation is a line and so will always have the same slope while the
function's slope will change as $x$ changes and so the function will, in all
likelihood, move away from the linear approximation.

Here's a quick sketch of the function and its linear approximation at $x = 8$.

![image 4.11_2](./4.11_2.png)

As noted above, the farther from $x = 8$ we get the more distance separates the
function itself and its linear approximation.

---

Linear approximations do a very good job of approximating values of $f(x)$ as
long as we stay "near" $x = a$. However, athe farther away from $x = a$ we get
the worse the approximation is liable to be. The main problem here is that how
near we need to stay to $x = a$ in order to get a good approximation will depend
upon both the function we're using and the value of $x = a$ that we're using.
Also, there will often be no easy way of predicting how far away from $x = a$ we
can get and still have a "good" approximation.

Let's take a look at another example that is actually used fairly heavily in
some places.

---

**Example 2** Determine the linear approximation for $\sin\theta$ at
$\theta = 0$.

**Solution**

Again, there really isn't a whole lot to this example. All that we need to do is
compute the tangent line to $\sin\theta$ at $\theta = 0$

$$ f(\theta) = \sin\theta \quad \quad f'(\theta) = \cos\theta $$

$$ f(0) = 0 \quad \quad f'(0) = 1 $$

The linear approximation is,

$$ L(\theta) = f(0) + f'(0)(\theta - a) $$

$$ \quad = 0 + (1)(\theta - 0) $$

$$ \quad = \theta $$

So, as long as $\theta$ stays small we can say that $\sin\theta \approx \theta$.

---

This is actually a somewhat important linear approximation. In optics this
linear approximation is often used to simplify formulas. This linear
approximation is also used to help describe the motion of a pendulum and
vibrations in a string.

## Practice Problems

For problems 1 & 2 find a linear approximation to the function at the given
point.

**1.** $f(x) = 3x\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10}$ at $x = 5$

**Solution**

Again, the basic formula for Linear Approximations is:

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

So first we'll need to simply find the first derivative for $f(x)$:

$$ f(x) = 3x\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10} $$

$$ f'(x) = (3x)'(\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10}) + (3x)(\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10})' $$

$$ f'(x) = 3\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10} + 3x(\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10})(2x - 10)' $$

$$ f'(x) = 3\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10} + 3x(\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10})(2) $$

$$ f'(x) = 3\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10} + 6x\mathbf{e}^{2x - 10} $$

Now plug in $x = 5$ for both $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$:

$$ f(5) = 15 $$

$$ f'(5) = 33 $$

And now finally plug this into our Linear Approximation formula:

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = f(5) + f'(5)(x - 5) $$

$$ L(x) = 15 + 33(x - 5) $$

$$ L(x) = 15 + 33x - 165 $$

$$ \boxed{L(x) = 33x - 150} $$

Paul provides a

of the function and it's tangent line/linear approximation.

**2.** $h(t) = t^4 - 6t^3 + 3t - 7$ at $t = -3$

**Solution**

$$ h'(t) = 4t^3 - 18t^2 + 3 $$

$$ h(-3) = 227 $$

$$ h'(-3) = -267  $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(t) = 227 + (-267)(t - (-3)) $$

$$ L(t) = 227 + (-267)(t + 3) $$

$$ L(t) = 227 + -267t - 801 $$

$$ \boxed{L(x) = -267t - 574} $$

**3.** Find the linear approximation to $g(z) = \sqrt[4]{z}$ at $z = 2$. Use the
linear approximation to approximate the value of $\sqrt[4]{3}$ and
$\sqrt[4]{10}$. Compare the approximated values to the exact values.

**Solution**

$$ g(z) = \sqrt[4]{z} $$

$$ g(z) = z^{\frac{1}{4}} $$

$$ g'(z) =\frac{1}{4}z^{-\frac{3}{4}}  $$

$$ g'(z) =\frac{1}{4\sqrt[4]{z^3}} $$

$$ g(2) = \sqrt[4]{2} \approx 1.1892 $$

$$ g'(2) = \frac{1}{4\sqrt[4]{2^3}} \approx 0.1487 $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(z) = g(2) + g'(2)(z - 2) $$

$$ L(z) = \sqrt[4]{2} + \left(\frac{1}{4\sqrt[4]{2^3}}\right)(z - 2) $$

First approximation $\sqrt[4]{3}$:

$$ L(3) = \sqrt[4]{2} + \left(\frac{1}{4\sqrt[4]{2^3}}\right)(3 - 2) $$

$$ L(3) \approx 1.3379 $$

Exact Calculation:

$$ g(3) = \sqrt[4]{3} \approx 1.3161 $$

Second approximation $\sqrt[4]{10}$:

$$ L(10) = \sqrt[4]{2} + \left(\frac{1}{4\sqrt[4]{2^3}}\right)(10 - 2) $$

$$ L(10) \approx 2.3784 $$

Exact Calculation:

$$ g(10) = \sqrt[4]{10} \approx 1.7783 $$

We can calculate the error percentage with the following formula:

$$ \text{Percent Error} = \frac{| \text{Absolute Value } - \text{ Exact Value}|}{|\text{Exact Value}|} \times 100 $$

So for approximation of $\sqrt[4]{3}$, we can calculate the error percentage
like so:

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \frac{|1.3379 - 1.3161|}{|1.3161|}(100) \approx 1.6564\% $$

And the percent error for $\sqrt[4]{10}$ is:

$$ L(10) \approx 2.3784 $$

Exact Calculation:

$$ g(10) = \sqrt[4]{10} \approx 1.7783 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \frac{|2.3784 - 1.7783|}{|1.7783|}(100) \approx 33.7457\% $$

**4.** Find the linear approximation to $f(t) = \cos(2t)$ at $t = \dfrac{1}{2}$.
Use the linear approximation to approxiamte the values of $\cos(2)$ and
$\cos(18)$. Compare the approximated values to the exact values.

**Solution**

$$ f'(t) = -2\sin(2t) $$

$$ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \cos\left(2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) = \cos(1) $$

$$ f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -2\sin\left(2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) = -2\sin(1) $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(t) = \cos(1) - 2\sin(1)\left(t - \frac{1}{2}\right) $$

First approximation of $\cos(2)$:

$$ L(1) = \cos(1) - 2\sin(1)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) $$

$$ L(1) \approx -0.3012 $$

Actual $\cos(2)$:

$$ f(1) = \cos(2(1)) \approx -0.4161 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 27.6136\% $$

Second approximation of $\cos(18)$:

$$ L(9) = \cos(1) - 2\sin(1)\left(9 - \frac{1}{2}\right) $$

$$ L(9) \approx -13.7647 $$

Actual $\cos(18)$:

$$ f(9) = \cos(2(9)) \approx 0.6603 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 2184.6131\% $$

**5.** Without using any kind of computational aid use a linear approximation to
estimate the value of $\mathbf{e}^{0.1}$.

**Solution**

Let's first express this as a function:

$$ f(x) = \mathbf{e}^x $$

The derivative would be:

$$ f'(x) = \mathbf{e}^x $$

We'll also need a point to test that is close to $0.1$, $0$ should suffice:

$$ f(0) = \mathbf{e}^0 = 1 $$

$$ f'(0) = \mathbf{e}^0 =  1 $$

The Linear Approximation would be:

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = f(0) + f'(0)(x - 0) $$

$$ L(x) = 1 + 1(x) $$

$$ L(x) = 1 + x $$

Now if we plug in our approximation we should get:

$$ L(0.1) = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1 $$

So our approximation is:

$$ \boxed{\mathbf{e}^{0.1} \approx L(0.1) = 1.1} $$

For reference the more accurate answer is $\mathbf{e}^{0.1} \approx 1.1052$ and
the error percentage is $0.4679\%$.

## Assignment Problems

For problems 1 – 4 find a linear approximation to the function at the given
point.

**1.** $f(x) = \cos(2x)$ at $x = \pi$

$$ h'(z) = \frac{2z}{z^2 + 5} $$

$$ h(2) = \ln\left((2)^2 + 5\right) $$

$$ h(2) = \ln(9) $$

$$ h'(2) = \frac{2(2)}{(2)^2 + 5} $$

$$ h'(2) = \frac{4}{9} $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ \boxed{L(x) = \ln(9) + \frac{4}{9}(x - 2)} $$

**3.** $g(x) = 2 - 9x - 3x^2 - x^3$ at $x = -1$

**Solution**

$$ g'(x) = -9 - 6x - 3x^2 $$

$$ g(-1) = 2 - 9(-1) - 3(-1)^2 - (-1)^3 $$

$$ g(-1) = 9 $$

$$ g'(-1) = -9 - 6(-1) - 3(-1)^2 $$

$$ g'(-1) = -6 $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = 9 + (-6)(x - (-1)) $$

$$ L(x) = 9 - 6(x + 1) $$

$$ L(x) = 9 - 6x - 6 $$

$$ \boxed{L(x) = -6x + 3} $$

**4.** $g(t) = \mathbf{e}^{\sin(t)}$ at $t = -4$

**Solution**

$$ g'(t) = \cos(t)\mathbf{e}^{\sin(t)} $$

$$ g(-4) = \mathbf{e}^{\sin(-4)} \approx 2.1314 $$

$$ g'(-4) = \cos(-4)\mathbf{e}^{\sin(-4)} \approx -1.3932 $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = \mathbf{e}^{\sin(-4)} + \left[\cos(-4)\mathbf{e}^{\sin(-4)}\right](x - (-4)) $$

$$ \boxed{L(x) = \mathbf{e}^{\sin(-4)} + (x + 4)\cos(-4)\mathbf{e}^{\sin(-4)}} $$

**5.** Find the linear approximation to $h(y) = \sin(y + 1)$ at $y = 0$. Use the
linear approximation to approximate the value of $\sin(2)$ and $\sin(15)$.
Compare the approximated values to the exact values.

**Solution**

$$ h'(y) = \cos(y + 1) $$

$$ h(0) = \sin(0 + 1) \approx 0.8415 $$

$$ h'(0) = \cos(0 + 1) \approx 0.5403 $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = \sin(1) + \cos(1)(x - 0) $$

$$ L(x) = \sin(1) + x\cos(1) $$

First approximation for $\sin(2)$:

$$ L(1) = \sin(1) + (1)\cos(1) $$

$$ L(1) \approx 1.3818 $$

Actual value of $\sin(2)$:

$$ h(1) = \sin(1 + 1) = \sin(2) \approx  0.9093 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error: } \approx 51.9630\% $$

Second approximation for $\sin(15)$

$$ L(14) = \sin(1) + (14)\cos(1) $$

$$ L(14) \approx 8.4057 $$

Actual value of $\sin(15)$:

$$ h(14) = \sin(14 + 1) = \sin(15) \approx 0.6503 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 1192.5880\% $$

**6.** Find the linear approximation to $R(t) = \sqrt[5]{t}$ at $t = 32$. Use
the linear approximation to approximate the value of $\sqrt[5]{31}$ and
$\sqrt[5]{3}$. Compare the approximated values to the exact values.

**Solution**

$$ R(t) = \sqrt[5]{t} $$

$$ R(t) = t^{\frac{1}{5}} $$

$$ R'(t) = \frac{1}{5}t^{-\frac{4}{5}} $$

$$ R'(t) = \frac{1}{5\sqrt[5]{t^4}} $$

$$ R(32) = \sqrt[5]{32} = 2 $$

$$ R'(32) = \frac{1}{5\sqrt[5]{(32)^4}} = \frac{1}{80} = 0.0125 $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = 2 + \left(\frac{1}{80}\right)(x - 32) $$

First approximation of $\sqrt[5]{31}$:

$$ L(31) = 2 + \left(\frac{1}{80}\right)(31 - 32) $$

$$ L(31) = \frac{159}{80} = 1.9875 $$

Actual calculation:

$$ h(31) = \sqrt[5]{31} \approx 1.9873 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 0.0101\%  $$

Second approximation of $\sqrt[5]{3}$:

$$ L(3) = 2 + \left(\frac{1}{80}\right)(3 - 32) $$

$$ L(3) = \frac{131}{80} = 1.6375 $$

Actual calcuation:

$$ h(3) = \sqrt[5]{3} \approx 1.2457 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 31.4522\%  $$

**7.** Find the linear approximation to $h(x) = \mathbf{e}^{1 - x}$ at $x = 1$.
Use the linear approximation to approximate the value of $\mathbf{e}$ and
$\mathbf{e}^{-4}$. Compare the approximated values to the exact values.

$$ h'(x) = -\mathbf{e}^{1 - x} $$

$$ h(1) = \mathbf{e}^{1 - 1} = \mathbf{e}^0 = 1 $$

$$ h'(1) = -\mathbf{e}^{1 - x} = -\mathbf{e}^0 = -1 $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = 1 + (-1)(x - 1) $$

$$ L(x) = 1 - x + 1 $$

$$ L(x) = 2 - x $$

First approximation of $\mathbf{e}$:

$$ L(0) = 2 - (0) $$

$$ L(0) = 2 $$

Actual calculation:

$$ h(0) = \mathbf{e}^{1 - (0)} = \mathbf{e}^1 = \mathbf{e} \approx 2.7183 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 26.4241% $$

Second approximation of $\mathbf{e}^{-4}$:

$$ L(5) = 2 - (5) $$

$$ L(5) = -3 $$

Actual calculation:

$$ h(5) = \mathbf{e}^{1 - (5)} = \mathbf{e}^{-4} \approx 0.0183 $$

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 16493.4426\%  $$

For problems 8 – 10 estimate the given value using a linear approximation and
without using any kind of computational aid.

**8.** $\ln(1.1)$

**Solution**

Express as function

$$ f(a) = \ln(a) $$

$$ f'(a) = \frac{1}{a} $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = \ln(a) + \left(\frac{1}{a}\right)(x - a) $$

Now just plug in $1.1$:

$$ L(x) = \ln(1.1) + \left(\frac{1}{1.1}\right)(x - 1.1) $$

Because we cannot compute $\ln(1.1)$ without a computational aid, let's choose
an easier number that's close to this we know the answer to, like $\ln(1) = 0$:

$$ L(x) \approx \ln(1) + \left(\frac{1}{1}\right)(x - 1) $$

$$ L(x) \approx 0 + x - 1 $$

$$ L(x) \approx x - 1 $$

Now plug in 1.1 to get an approximation:

$$ \ln(1.1) \approx L(1.1) = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1 $$

For reference the actual calculation for $\ln(1.1)$ is:

$$ \ln(1.1) \approx 0.0953 $$

Which is pretty close, the error percentage is:

$$ \%\text{ Error : } \approx 4.9318\% $$

**9.** $\sqrt{8.9}$

**Solution**

Define as a function:

$$ f(a) = \sqrt{a} $$

$$ f'(a) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}} $$

$$ L(x) = \sqrt{a} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}}(x - a) $$

Since we can't plug in $\sqrt{8.9}$ directly, take the $\sqrt{9} = 3$ as an
easy, close by number to use as an approximation:

$$ L(x) \approx \sqrt{9} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{9}}(x - 9) $$

$$ L(x) \approx 3 + \frac{1}{6}(x - 9) $$

Then just plug in $8.9$ to get an approximate:

$$ \sqrt{8.9} \approx L(8.9) = 3 + \frac{1}{6}(8.9 - 9) \approx 2.9833 $$

The actual value for $\sqrt{8.9}$ is:

$$ \sqrt{8.9} \approx 2.9833 $$

Which is the same, we'd have to round to a more exact number before finding the
actual error percentage, but the purposes of this exercise, we can say that the
error percentage is $0\%$.

**10.** $\sec(0.1)$

**Solution**

Define this as a function:

$$ f(a) = \sec(a) $$

$$ f'(a) = \sec(a)\tan(a) $$

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

$$ L(x) = \sec(a) + \sec(a)\tan(a)(x - a) $$

Again, because we can't calculate $\sec(0.1)$ nor $\sec(0.1)\tan(0.1)$ without a
computational aid, let's instead use a close by number that we can easily
calculate, like $\sec(0) = 1$ and $\tan(0) = 0$

$$ L(x) \approx \sec(0) + \sec(0)\tan(0)(x - 0) $$

$$ L(x) \approx 1 + 0(x - 0) $$

$$ L(x) \approx 1 $$

Now we can plug in $(0.1)$

$$ \sec(0.1) \approx L(0.1) = 1 $$

The actual value for $\sec(0.1)$ is:

$$ \sec(0.1) \approx 1.0050 $$

Which is pretty close, let's take a look at the error percentage:

$$ \%\text{ Error : } 0.4975\% $$
