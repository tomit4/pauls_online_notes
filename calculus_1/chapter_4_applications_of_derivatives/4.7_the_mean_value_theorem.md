# Section 4.7 : The Mean Value Theorem

In this section we want to take a look at the Mean Value Theorem. In most
traditional textbooks this section comes before the sections containing the
First and Second Derivative Tests because many of the proofs in those sections
need the Mean Value Theorem. However, we feel that from a logical point of view
it’s better to put the Shape of a Graph sections right after the absolute
extrema section. So, if you've been following the proofs from the previous two
sections you’ve probably already read through this section.

Before we get to the Mean Value Theorem we need to cover the following theorem.

**Rolle's Theorem**

> Supose $f(x)$ is a function that satisfies all of the following.
>
> 1. $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$.
> 2. $f(x)$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$.
> 3. $f(a) = f(b)$
>
> Then there is a number $c$ such that $a < c < b$ and $f'(c) = 0$. Or, in other
> words $f(x)$ has a critical point in $(a, b)$.

To see the proof of Rolle's Theorem see the
[**Proofs From Derivative Applications**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DerivativeAppsProofs.aspx#Extras_DerAppPf_Rolles)
section of the Extras chapter.

Let's take a look at a quick example that uses Rolle's Theorem.

---

**Example 1** Show that $f(x) = 4x^5 + x^3 + 7x - 2$ has exactly one root.

**Solution**

From basic Algebra principles we know that since $f(x)$ is a 5<sup>th</sup>
degree polynomial it will have five roots. What we're being asked to prove here
is that only one of those 5 is a real number and the other 4 must be complex
roots.

First, we should show that it does have at least one real root. To do this note
that $f(0) = -2$ and that $f(1) = 10$ and so we can see that $f(0) < 0 < f(1)$.
Now, because $f(x)$ is a polynomial we know that it is continuous everywhere so
by the
[**Intermediate Value Theorem**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Continuity.aspx#IVT)
there is a number $c$ such that $0 < c < 1$ and $f(c) = 0$. In other words
$f(x)$ has at least one real root.

We now need to show that this is in fact the only real root. To do this we'll
use an argument that is called contradiction proof. What we’ll do is assume that
$f(x)$ has at least two real roots. This means that we can find real numbers $a$
and $b$ (there might be more, but all we need for this particular argument is
two) such that $f(a) = f(b) = 0$. But if we do this then we know from Rolle's
Theorem that there must then be another number $c$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

This is a problem however. The derivative of this function is,

$$ f'(x) = 20x^4 + 3x^2 +  $$

Because the exponents on the first two terms are even we know that the first two
terms will always be greater than or equal to zero and we are then going to add
a positive number onto that and so we can see that the smallest the derivative
will ever be is 7 and this contradicts the statement above that says we MUST
have a number $c$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

We reached these contradictory statements by assuming that $f(x)$ has at least
two roots. Since this assumption leads to a contradiction the assumption must be
false and so we can only have a single real root.

---

The reason for covering Rolle's Theorem is that it is needed in the proof of the
Mean Value Theorem. To see the proof see the
[**Proofs From Derivative Applications**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DerivativeAppsProofs.aspx#Extras_DerAppPf_MVT)
section of the Extras chapter. Here is the theorem.

**Mean Value Theorem**

> Suppose $f(x)$ is a function that satisfies both of the following.
>
> 1. $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$.
> 2. $f(x)$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$.
>
> Then there is a number $c$ such that $a < c < b$ and
>
> $$ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} $$
>
> Or,
>
> $$ f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b - a) $$

Note that the Mean Value Theorem doesn't tell us what $c$ is. It only tells us
that there is at least one number $c$ that will satisfy the conclusion of the
theorem.

Also note that if it weren't for the fact that we needed Rolle's Theorem to
prove this we could think of Rolle's Theorem as a special case of the Mean Value
Theorem. To see that just assume that $f(a) = f(b)$ and then the result of the
Mean Value Theorem gives the result of Rolle's Theorem.

Before we take a look at a couple of examples let's think about a geometric
interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem. First define
$A = \left(a, f(a)\right)$ and $B = \left(b, f(b)\right)$ and then we know from
the Mean Value Theorem that there is a $c$ such that $a < c < b$ and that

$$ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} $$

Now, if we draw in the secant line connecting $A$ and $B$ then we can know that
the slope of the secant line is,

$$ \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} $$

Likewise, if we draw in the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x = c$ we know that its
slope is $f'(c)$.

What the Mean Value Theorem tells us is that these two slopes must be equal or
in other words the secant line connecting $A$ and $B$ and the tangent line at
$x = c$ must be parallel. We can see this in the following sketch.

Let's now take a look at a couple of examples using the Mean Value Theorem.

---

**Example 2** Determine all the numbers $c$ which satisfy the conclusions of the
Mean Value Theorem for the following function.

$$ f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x \quad \text{ on } \quad [-1, 2] $$

**Solution**

There isn't really a whole lot to this problem other than to notice that since
$f(x)$ is a polynomial it is both continuous and differentiable (_i.e._ the
derivative exists) on the interval given.

First let's find the derivative.

$$ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$

Now, to find the numbers that satisfy the conclusions of the Mean Value Theorem
all we need to do is plug this into the formula given by the Mean Value Theorem.

$$ f'(c) = \frac{f(2) - f(-1)}{2 - (-1)} $$

$$ 3c^2 + 4c - 1 = \frac{14 - 2}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 $$

Now, this is just a quadratic equation,

$$ 3c^2 + 4c - 1 = 4 $$

$$ 3c^2 + 4c - 5 = 0 $$

Using the quadratic formula on this we get,

$$ c = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4(3)(-5)}}{6} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{76}}{6} $$

Notice that only one of these is actually in the interval given in the problem.
That means that we will exclude the second one (since it isn't in the interval).
The number that we're after in this problem is

$$ c = 0.7863 $$

Be careful to not assume that only one of the numbers will work. It is possible
for both of them to work.

---

**Example 3** Suppose that we know that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable
on $[6, 15]$. Let's also suppose that we know that $f(6) = -2$ and that we know
that $f'(x) \leq 10$. What is the largest possible value for $f(15)$?

**Solution**

Let's start with the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem.

$$ f(15) - f(6) = f'(c)(15 - 6) $$

Plugging in for the known quantitites and rewriting this a little gives,

$$ f(15) = f(6) + f'(c)(15 - 6) = -2 + 9f'(c) $$

Now we know that $f'(x) \leq 10$ so in particular we know that $f'(c) \leq 10$.
This gives us the following,

$$ f(15) = -2 + 9f'(c) $$

$$ \quad \leq -2 + (9)10 $$

$$ \quad = 88 $$

All we did was replace $f'(c)$ with its largest possible value.

This means that the largest possible value for $f(15)$ is 88.

---

**Example 4** Suppose that we know that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable
everywhere. Let's also suppose that we know that $f(x)$ has two roots. Show that
$f'(x)$ must have at least one root.

**Solution**

It is important to note here that all we can say is that $f'(x)$ will have at
least one root. We can't say that it will have exactly one root. So don't
confuse this problem with the first one we worked.

This is actually a fairly simple thing to prove. Since we know that $f(x)$ has
two roots let's suppose that they are $a$ and $b$. Now, by assumption we know
that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable everywhere and so in particular it
is continous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$.

Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem there is a number $c$ that is between $a$
and $b$ (this isn't needed for this problem, but it's true so it should be
pointed out) and that,

$$ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} $$

But we now need to recall that $a$ and $b$ are roots of $f(x)$ and so this is,

$$ f'(c) = \frac{0 - 0}{b - a} = 0 $$

Or, $f'(x)$ has a root at $x = c$.

Again, it is important to note that we don't have a value of $c$. We have only
shown that it exists. We also haven't said anything about $c$ being the only
root. It is completely possible for $f'(x)$ to have more than one root.

---

It is completely possible to generalize the previous example significantly. For
isntance if we know that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable everywhere and
has three roots we can then show that not only will $f'(x)$ have at least two
roots but that $f''(x)$ will have at least one root. We'll leave it to you to
verify this, but the ideas involved are identical to those in the previous
example.

We'll close this section out witha couple of nice facts that can be proved using
the Mean Value Theorem. Note that in both of these facts we are assuming the
functions are continuous and differentiable on the interval $[a, b]$.

**Fact 1**

> If $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in an interval $(a, b)$ then $f(x)$ is constant on
> $(a, b)$.

This fact is very easy to prove so let's do that here.

First, notice that because we are assuming the derivative exists on $(a, b)$ we
know that $f(x)$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$. In addition we
[**know**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DefnOfDerivative.aspx#Deriv_Defn_DifCont)
that if a function is differentiable on an interval then it is also continuous
on that interval and so $f(x)$ will also be continuous on $(a, b)$.

Now, take any two $x$'s in the interval $(a, b)$, say $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then
since $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable on $(a, b)$ it must also be
continuous and differentiable on $[x_1, x_2]$. This means that we can apply the
Mean Value Theorem for these two values of $x$. Doing this gives,

$$ f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f'(c)(x_2 - x_1) $$

where $x_1 < c < x_2$. But by assumption $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in an interval
$(a, b)$ and so in particular we must have,

$$ f'(c) = 0 $$

Putting this into the equation above gives,

$$ f(x_2) - f(x_1) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(x_2) = f(x_1) $$

Now, since $x_1$ and $x_2$ were any two values of $x$ in the interval $(a, b)$
we can see that we must have $f(x_2)$ = f(x_1)$ for all $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the
interval and this is exactly what it means for a function to be constant on the
interval and so we've proven the fact.

**Fact 2**

> If $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x$ in an interval $(a, b)$ then in this interval
> we have $f(x) = g(x) + c$ where $c$ is some constant.

This fact is a direct result of the previous fact and is also easy to prove.

If we first define,

$$ h(x) = f(x) - g(x) $$

Then since both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continuous and differentiable in the
interval $(a, b)$ then so must be $h(x)$. Therefore, the derivative of $h(x)$
is,

$$ h'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x) $$

However, by assumption $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x$ in an interval $(a, b)$ and
so we must have that $h'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in an interval $(a, b)$. So, by
Fact 1 $h(x)$ must be constant on the interval.

This means that we have,

$$ h(x) = c $$

$$ f(x) - g(x) = c $$

$$ f(x) = g(x) + c $$

which is what we were trying to show.
