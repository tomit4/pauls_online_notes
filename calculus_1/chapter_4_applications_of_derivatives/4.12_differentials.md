# Section 4.12 : Differentials

In this section we're going to introduce a notation that we'll be seeing quite a
bit in the next chapter. We will also look at an application of this new
notation.

Given a function $y = f(x)$ we call $dy$ and $dx$ differentials and the
relationship between them is given by,

$$ dy = f'(x)dx $$

Note that if we are just given $f(x)$ then the differentials are $df$ and $dx$
and we compute them in the same manner.

$$ df = f'(x)dx $$

Let's compute a couple of differentials.

---

**Example 1** Compute the differential for each of the following.

**Solution**

Before working any of these we should first discuss just what we're being asked
to find here. We defined two differentials earlier and here we're being asked to
compute a differential.

So, which differential are we being asked to compute? In this kind of problem
we're being asked to compute the differential of the function. In other words,
$dy$ for the first problem, $dw$ for the second problem and $df$ for the third
problem.

Here are the solutions. Not much to do here other than take a derivative and
don't forget to add on the second differential to the derivative.

**(a)** $y = t^3 - 4t^2 + 7t$

**Solution**

$$ dy = \left(3t^2 - 8t + 7\right)dt $$

**(b)** $w = x^2\sin(2x)$

**Solution**

$$ dw = \left(2x\sin(2x) + 2x^2\cos(2x)\right)dx $$

**\(c\)** $f(z) = \mathbf{e}^{3 - z^4}$

**Solution**

$$ df = -4z^3\mathbf{e}^{3 - z^4}dz $$

There is a nice application to differentials. If we think of $\Delta x$ as the
change in $x$ then $\Delta y = f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)$ is the change in $y$
corresponding to the change in $x$. Now, if $\Delta x$ is small we can assume
that $\Delta y \approx dy$. Let's see an illustration of this idea.

---

**Example 2** Compute $dy$ and $\Delta y$ if $y = \cos\left(x^2 + 1\right) - x$
as $x$ changes from $x = 2$ to $x = 2.03$.

**Solution**

First let's compute actual the change in $y$, $\Delta y$.

$$ \Delta y = \cos\left((2.03)^2 + 1\right) - 2.03 - \left(\cos(2^2 + 1) - 2\right) = 0.083581127 $$

Now let's get the formula for $dy$.

$$ dy = \left(-2x\sin\left(x^2 + 1\right) - 1\right)dx $$

Next, the change in $x$ from $x = 2$ to $x = 2.03$ is $\Delta x = 0.03$ and so
we then assume that $dx = \Delta x = 0.03$. This gives an approximate change in
$y$ of,

$$ dy = \left(-2(2)\sin\left(2^2 + 1\right) - 1\right)(0.03) = 0.085070913 $$

We can see that in fact we do have that $\Delta y \approx dy$ provided we keep
$\Delta x$ small.

---

We can use the fact that $\Delta y \approx dy$ in the following way.

**Example 3** A sphere was measured and its radius was found to be 45 inches
with a possible error of no more than 0.01 inches. What is the maximum possible
error in the volume if we use this avlue of the radius?

**Solution**

First, recall the equation for the volume of a sphere.

$$ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 $$

Now, if we start with $r = 45$ and use $dr \approx \Delta r = 0.01$ then
$\Delta V \approx dV$ should give us maximum error.

So, first get the formula for the differential.

$$ dV = 4\pi r^2dr $$

Now compute $dV$.

$$ \Delta V \approx dV = 4\pi(45)^2(0.01) = 254.47 \text{ in}^3 $$

The maximum error in the volume is then approximately 254.47 in<sup>3</sup>.

Be careful to not assume this is a large error. On the surface it looks large,
however if we compute the actual volume for $r = 45$ we get
$V = 381,703.51 \text{ in}^3$. So, in comparison the error in the volume is,

$$ \frac{254.47}{381703.51} \times 100 = 0.067\% $$

That's not much possible error at all!
