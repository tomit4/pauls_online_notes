# Section 6.3 : Volume With Rings

In this section we will start looking at the volume of a solid of revolution. We
should first define just what a solid of revolution is. To get a solid of
revolution we start out with a function, $y = f(x)$, on an interval $[a, b]$.

![image 6.3_1](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image001.gif)

We then rotate this curve about a given axis to get the surface of the solid of
revolution. For purposes of this discussion let's rotate the curve about the
$x$-axis, although it could be any vertical or horizontal axis. Doing this for
the curve above gives the following three dimensional region.

![image 6.3_2](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image002.gif)

What we want to do over the course of the next two sections is to determine the
volume of this object.

In the
[**Area and Volume Formulas**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Area_Volume_Formulas.aspx)
section of the Extras chapter we derived the following formulas for the volume
of this solid.

> $$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} \quad V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

where, $A(x)$ and $A(y)$ are the cross-sectional area functions of the solid.
There are many ways to get the cross-sectional area and we'll see two (or three
depending on how you look at it) over the next two sections. Whether we will use
$A(x)$ or $A(y)$ will depend upon the method and the axis of rotation used for
each problem.

One of the easier methods for getting the cross-sectional area is to cut the
object perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Doing this the cross section will
be either a solid disk if the object is solid (as our above example is) or a
ring if we've hollowed out a portion of the solid (we will see this eventually).

In the case that we get a solid disk the area is,

$$ A = \pi(\text{radius})^2 $$

where the radius will depend upon the function and the axis of rotation.

In the case that we get a ring the area is,

$$ A = \pi\left(\left(\text{outer radius}\right)^2 - \left(\text{inner radius}\right)^2\right) $$

where again both of the radii will depend on the functions given and the axis of
rotation. Note as well that in the case of a solid disk we can think of the
inner radius as zero and we’ll arrive at the correct formula for a solid disk
and so this is a much more general formula to use.

Also, in both cases, whether the area is a function of $x$ or a function of $y$
will depend upon the axis of rotation as we will see.

This method is often called the **method of disks** or the **method of rings**.

Let's do an example.

---

**Example 1** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = x^2 - 4x + 5$, $x = 1$, $x = 4$, and the $x$-axis about the
$x$-axis.

**Solution**

The first thing to do is get a sketch of the bounding region and the solid
obtained by rotating the region about the $x$-axis. We don't need a picture
perfect sketch of the curves we just need something that will allow us to get a
feel for what the bounded region looks like so we can get a quick sketch of the
solid. With that in mind we can note that the first equation is just a parabola
with vertex $(2,1)$ (you do remember how to get the
[**vertex**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CommonGraphs.aspx#Rev_Graph_Ex3)
of a parabola right?) and opens upward and so we don't really need to put a lot
of time into sketching it.

Here are both of these sketches.

![image 6.3_3](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image003.gif)

![image 6.3_4](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image004.gif)

Okay, to get a cross section we cut the solid at any $x$. Below are a couple of
sketches showing a typical cross section. The sketch on the right shows a cut
away of the object with a typical cross section without the caps. The sketch on
the left shows just the curve we’re rotating as well as its mirror image along
the bottom of the solid.

![image 6.3_5](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image005.gif)

![image 6.3_6](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image006.gif)

In this case the radius is simply the distance from the $x$-axis to the curve
and this is nothing more than the function value at that particular $x$ as shown
above. The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(x^2 - 4x + 5\right)^2 = \pi\left(x^4 - 8x^3 + 26x^2 - 40x + 25\right) $$

Next, we need to determine the limits of integration. Working from left to right
the first cross section will occur at $x = 1$ and the last cross section will
occur at $x = 4$ . These are the limits of integration.

The volume of this solid is then,

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{1}^{4}{x^4 - 8x^3 + 26x^2 - 40x + 25\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \pi\left(\frac{1}{5}x^5 - 2x^4 + \frac{26}{3}x^3 - 20x^2 + 25x\right) \right|_{1}^{4} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{78\pi}{5} $$

---

In the above example the object was a solid object, but the more interesting
objects are those that are not solid so let’s take a look at one of those.

---

**Example 2** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the portion
of the region bounded by $y = \sqrt[3]{x}$ and $y = \dfrac{x}{4}$ that lies in
the first quadrant about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

First, let's get a graph of the bounding region and a graph of the object.
Remember that we only want the portion of the bounding region that lies in the
first quadrant. There is a portion of the bounding region that is in the third
quadrant as well, but we don't want that for this problem.

![image 6.3_7](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image007.gif)

![image 6.3_8](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image008.gif)

There are a couple of things to note with this problem. First, we are only
looking for the volume of the "walls" of this solid, not the complete interior
as we did in the last example.

Next, we will get our cross section by cutting the object perpendicular to the
axis of rotation. The cross section will be a ring (remember we are only looking
at the walls) for this example and it will be horizontal at some $y$. This means
that the inner and outer radius for the ring will be $x$ values and so we will
need to rewrite our functions into the form $x = f(y)$. Here are the functions
written in the correct form for this example.

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \frac{x}{4} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 4y $$

Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the walls of this object as
well as a typical ring. The sketch on the left includes the back portion of the
object to give a little context to the figure on the right.

![image 6.3_9](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image009.gif)

![image 6.3_10](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image010.gif)

The inner radius in this case is the distance from the $y$-axis to the inner
curve while the outer radius is the distance from the $y$-axis to the outer
curve. Both of these are then $x$ distances and so are given by the equations of
the curves as shown above.

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(y) = \pi\left(\left(4y\right)^2 - \left(y^3\right)^2\right) = \pi\left(16y^2 - y^6\right) $$

Working from the bottom of the solid to the top we can see that the first
cross-section will occur at $y = 0$ and the last cross-section will occur at
$y = 2$. These will be the limits of integration. The volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{0}^{2}{16y^2 - y^6\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \pi\left(\frac{16}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{7}y^7\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{512\pi}{21} $$

---

With these two examples out of the way we can now make a generalization about
this method. If we rotate about a horizontal axis (the $x$-axis for example)
then the cross-sectional area will be a function of $x$. Likewise, if we rotate
about a vertical axis (the $y$-axis for example) then the cross-sectional area
will be a function of $y$.

The remaining two examples in this section will make sure that we don’t get too
used to the idea of always rotating about the $x$ or $y$-axis.

---

**Example 3** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = x^2 - 2x$ and $y = x$ about the line $y = 4$.

**Solution**

First let's get the bounding region and the solid graphed.

![image 6.3_11](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image011.gif)

![image 6.3_12](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image012.gif)

Again, we are going to be looking for the volume of the walls of this object.
Also, since we are rotating about a horizontal axis we know that the
cross-sectional area will be a function of $x$.

Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the walls of this object as
well as a typical ring. The sketch on the left includes the back portion of the
object to give a little context to the figure on the right.

![image 6.3_13](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image013.gif)

![image 6.3_14](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image014.gif)

Now, we're going to have to be careful here in determining the inner and outer
radius as they aren't going to be quite as simple they were in the previous two
examples.

Let's start with the inner radius as this one is a little clearer. First, the
inner radius is NOT $x$. The distance from the $x$-axis to the inner edge of the
ring is $x$, but we want the radius and that is the distance from the axis of
rotation to the inner edge of the ring. So, we know that the distance from the
axis of rotation to the $x$-axis is $4$ and the distance from the $x$-axis to
the inner ring is $x$. The inner radius must then be the difference between
these two. Or,

$$ \text{inner radius} = 4 - x $$

The 9uter radius works the same way. The outer radius is,

$$ \text{outer radius} = 4 - \left(x^2 - 2x\right) = -x^2 + 2x + 4 $$

Note that given the location of the typical ring in the sketch above the formula
for the outer radius may not look quite right but it is in fact correct. As
sketched the outer edge of the ring is below the $x$-axis and at this point the
value of the function will be negative and so when we do the subtraction in the
formula for the outer radius we'll actually be subtracting off a negative number
which has the net effect of adding this distance onto $4$ and that gives the
correct outer radius. Likewise, if the outer edge is above the $x$-axis, the
function value will be positive and so we'll be doing an honest subtraction here
and again we'll get the correct radius in this case.

The cross-sectional area for this case is,

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(\left(-x^2 + 2x + 4\right)^2 - (4 - x)^2\right) = \pi\left(x^4 - 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 24x\right) $$

The first ring will occur at $x = 0$ and the last ring will occur at $x = 3$ and
so these are our limits of integration. The volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{0}^{3}{x^4 - 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 24x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad \left. \pi\left(\frac{1}{5}x^5 - x^4 - \frac{5}{3}x^3 + 12x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{3} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{153\pi}{} $$

---

**Example 4** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = 2\sqrt{x - 1}$ and $y = x - 1$ about the line $x = -1$.

**Solution**

As with the previous examples, let's first graph the bounded region and the
solid.

![image 6.3_15](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image015.gif)

![image 6.3_16](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image016.gif)

Now, let's notice that since we are rotating about a vertical axis and so the
cross-sectional area will be a function of $y$. This also means that we are
going to have to rewrite the functions to also get them in terms of $y$.

$$ y = 2\sqrt{x - 1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{y^2}{4} + 1 $$

$$ y = x - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y + 1 $$

Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the walls of this object as
well as a typical ring. The sketch on the left includes the back portion of the
object to give a little context to the figure on the right.

![image 6.3_17](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image017.gif)

![image 6.3_18](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image018.gif)

The inner and outer radius for this case is both similar and different from the
previous example. This example is similar in the sense that the radii are not
just the functions. In this example the functions are the distances from the
$y$-axis to the edges of the rings. The center of the ring however is a distance
of $1$ from the $y$-axis. This means that the distance from the center to the
edges is a distance from the axis of rotation to the $y$-axis (a distance of
$1$) and then from the $y$-axis to the edge of the rings.

So, the radii are then the functions plus $1$ and that is what makes this
example different from the previous example. Here we had to add the distance to
the function value whereas in the previous example we needed to subtract the
function from this distance. Note that without sketches the radii on these
problems can be difficult to get.

So, in summary, we've got the following for the inner and outer radius for this
example.

$$ \text{outer radius} = y + 1 + 1 = y + 2 $$

$$ \text{inner radius} = \frac{y^2}{4} + 1 + 1 = \frac{y^2}{4} + 2 $$

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(y) = \pi\left((y + 1)^2 - \left(\frac{y^2}{4} + 2\right)\right) = \pi\left(4y - \frac{y^4}{16}\right) $$

The first ring will occur at y=0 and the final ring will occur at $y = 4$ and so
these will be our limits of integration.

The volume is,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{0}^{4}{4y - \frac{y^4}{16}\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \pi\left(2y^2 - \frac{1}{80}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{4} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{96\pi}{5} $$
