# Section 6.3 : Volume With Rings

In this section we will start looking at the volume of a solid of revolution. We
should first define just what a solid of revolution is. To get a solid of
revolution we start out with a function, $y = f(x)$, on an interval $[a, b]$.

![image 6.3_1](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image001.gif)

We then rotate this curve about a given axis to get the surface of the solid of
revolution. For purposes of this discussion let's rotate the curve about the
$x$-axis, although it could be any vertical or horizontal axis. Doing this for
the curve above gives the following three dimensional region.

![image 6.3_2](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image002.gif)

What we want to do over the course of the next two sections is to determine the
volume of this object.

In the
[**Area and Volume Formulas**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Area_Volume_Formulas.aspx)
section of the Extras chapter we derived the following formulas for the volume
of this solid.

> $$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} \quad V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

where, $A(x)$ and $A(y)$ are the cross-sectional area functions of the solid.
There are many ways to get the cross-sectional area and we'll see two (or three
depending on how you look at it) over the next two sections. Whether we will use
$A(x)$ or $A(y)$ will depend upon the method and the axis of rotation used for
each problem.

One of the easier methods for getting the cross-sectional area is to cut the
object perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Doing this the cross section will
be either a solid disk if the object is solid (as our above example is) or a
ring if we've hollowed out a portion of the solid (we will see this eventually).

In the case that we get a solid disk the area is,

$$ A = \pi(\text{radius})^2 $$

where the radius will depend upon the function and the axis of rotation.

In the case that we get a ring the area is,

$$ A = \pi\left(\left(\text{outer radius}\right)^2 - \left(\text{inner radius}\right)^2\right) $$

where again both of the radii will depend on the functions given and the axis of
rotation. Note as well that in the case of a solid disk we can think of the
inner radius as zero and we’ll arrive at the correct formula for a solid disk
and so this is a much more general formula to use.

Also, in both cases, whether the area is a function of $x$ or a function of $y$
will depend upon the axis of rotation as we will see.

This method is often called the **method of disks** or the **method of rings**.

Let's do an example.

---

**Example 1** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = x^2 - 4x + 5$, $x = 1$, $x = 4$, and the $x$-axis about the
$x$-axis.

**Solution**

The first thing to do is get a sketch of the bounding region and the solid
obtained by rotating the region about the $x$-axis. We don't need a picture
perfect sketch of the curves we just need something that will allow us to get a
feel for what the bounded region looks like so we can get a quick sketch of the
solid. With that in mind we can note that the first equation is just a parabola
with vertex $(2,1)$ (you do remember how to get the
[**vertex**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CommonGraphs.aspx#Rev_Graph_Ex3)
of a parabola right?) and opens upward and so we don't really need to put a lot
of time into sketching it.

Here are both of these sketches.

![image 6.3_3](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image003.gif)

![image 6.3_4](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image004.gif)

Okay, to get a cross section we cut the solid at any $x$. Below are a couple of
sketches showing a typical cross section. The sketch on the right shows a cut
away of the object with a typical cross section without the caps. The sketch on
the left shows just the curve we’re rotating as well as its mirror image along
the bottom of the solid.

![image 6.3_5](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image005.gif)

![image 6.3_6](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image006.gif)

In this case the radius is simply the distance from the $x$-axis to the curve
and this is nothing more than the function value at that particular $x$ as shown
above. The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(x^2 - 4x + 5\right)^2 = \pi\left(x^4 - 8x^3 + 26x^2 - 40x + 25\right) $$

Next, we need to determine the limits of integration. Working from left to right
the first cross section will occur at $x = 1$ and the last cross section will
occur at $x = 4$ . These are the limits of integration.

The volume of this solid is then,

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{1}^{4}{x^4 - 8x^3 + 26x^2 - 40x + 25\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \pi\left(\frac{1}{5}x^5 - 2x^4 + \frac{26}{3}x^3 - 20x^2 + 25x\right) \right|_{1}^{4} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{78\pi}{5} $$

---

In the above example the object was a solid object, but the more interesting
objects are those that are not solid so let’s take a look at one of those.

---

**Example 2** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the portion
of the region bounded by $y = \sqrt[3]{x}$ and $y = \dfrac{x}{4}$ that lies in
the first quadrant about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

First, let's get a graph of the bounding region and a graph of the object.
Remember that we only want the portion of the bounding region that lies in the
first quadrant. There is a portion of the bounding region that is in the third
quadrant as well, but we don't want that for this problem.

![image 6.3_7](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image007.gif)

![image 6.3_8](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image008.gif)

There are a couple of things to note with this problem. First, we are only
looking for the volume of the "walls" of this solid, not the complete interior
as we did in the last example.

Next, we will get our cross section by cutting the object perpendicular to the
axis of rotation. The cross section will be a ring (remember we are only looking
at the walls) for this example and it will be horizontal at some $y$. This means
that the inner and outer radius for the ring will be $x$ values and so we will
need to rewrite our functions into the form $x = f(y)$. Here are the functions
written in the correct form for this example.

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \frac{x}{4} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 4y $$

Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the walls of this object as
well as a typical ring. The sketch on the left includes the back portion of the
object to give a little context to the figure on the right.

![image 6.3_9](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image009.gif)

![image 6.3_10](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image010.gif)

The inner radius in this case is the distance from the $y$-axis to the inner
curve while the outer radius is the distance from the $y$-axis to the outer
curve. Both of these are then $x$ distances and so are given by the equations of
the curves as shown above.

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(y) = \pi\left(\left(4y\right)^2 - \left(y^3\right)^2\right) = \pi\left(16y^2 - y^6\right) $$

Working from the bottom of the solid to the top we can see that the first
cross-section will occur at $y = 0$ and the last cross-section will occur at
$y = 2$. These will be the limits of integration. The volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{0}^{2}{16y^2 - y^6\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \pi\left(\frac{16}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{7}y^7\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{512\pi}{21} $$

---

With these two examples out of the way we can now make a generalization about
this method. If we rotate about a horizontal axis (the $x$-axis for example)
then the cross-sectional area will be a function of $x$. Likewise, if we rotate
about a vertical axis (the $y$-axis for example) then the cross-sectional area
will be a function of $y$.

The remaining two examples in this section will make sure that we don’t get too
used to the idea of always rotating about the $x$ or $y$-axis.

---

**Example 3** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = x^2 - 2x$ and $y = x$ about the line $y = 4$.

**Solution**

First let's get the bounding region and the solid graphed.

![image 6.3_11](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image011.gif)

![image 6.3_12](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image012.gif)

Again, we are going to be looking for the volume of the walls of this object.
Also, since we are rotating about a horizontal axis we know that the
cross-sectional area will be a function of $x$.

Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the walls of this object as
well as a typical ring. The sketch on the left includes the back portion of the
object to give a little context to the figure on the right.

![image 6.3_13](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image013.gif)

![image 6.3_14](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image014.gif)

Now, we're going to have to be careful here in determining the inner and outer
radius as they aren't going to be quite as simple they were in the previous two
examples.

Let's start with the inner radius as this one is a little clearer. First, the
inner radius is NOT $x$. The distance from the $x$-axis to the inner edge of the
ring is $x$, but we want the radius and that is the distance from the axis of
rotation to the inner edge of the ring. So, we know that the distance from the
axis of rotation to the $x$-axis is $4$ and the distance from the $x$-axis to
the inner ring is $x$. The inner radius must then be the difference between
these two. Or,

$$ \text{inner radius} = 4 - x $$

The 9uter radius works the same way. The outer radius is,

$$ \text{outer radius} = 4 - \left(x^2 - 2x\right) = -x^2 + 2x + 4 $$

Note that given the location of the typical ring in the sketch above the formula
for the outer radius may not look quite right but it is in fact correct. As
sketched the outer edge of the ring is below the $x$-axis and at this point the
value of the function will be negative and so when we do the subtraction in the
formula for the outer radius we'll actually be subtracting off a negative number
which has the net effect of adding this distance onto $4$ and that gives the
correct outer radius. Likewise, if the outer edge is above the $x$-axis, the
function value will be positive and so we'll be doing an honest subtraction here
and again we'll get the correct radius in this case.

The cross-sectional area for this case is,

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(\left(-x^2 + 2x + 4\right)^2 - (4 - x)^2\right) = \pi\left(x^4 - 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 24x\right) $$

The first ring will occur at $x = 0$ and the last ring will occur at $x = 3$ and
so these are our limits of integration. The volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{0}^{3}{x^4 - 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 24x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad \left. \pi\left(\frac{1}{5}x^5 - x^4 - \frac{5}{3}x^3 + 12x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{3} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{153\pi}{5} $$

---

**Example 4** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = 2\sqrt{x - 1}$ and $y = x - 1$ about the line $x = -1$.

**Solution**

As with the previous examples, let's first graph the bounded region and the
solid.

![image 6.3_15](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image015.gif)

![image 6.3_16](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image016.gif)

Now, let's notice that since we are rotating about a vertical axis and so the
cross-sectional area will be a function of $y$. This also means that we are
going to have to rewrite the functions to also get them in terms of $y$.

$$ y = 2\sqrt{x - 1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{y^2}{4} + 1 $$

$$ y = x - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y + 1 $$

Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the walls of this object as
well as a typical ring. The sketch on the left includes the back portion of the
object to give a little context to the figure on the right.

![image 6.3_17](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image017.gif)

![image 6.3_18](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWithRings_Files/image018.gif)

The inner and outer radius for this case is both similar and different from the
previous example. This example is similar in the sense that the radii are not
just the functions. In this example the functions are the distances from the
$y$-axis to the edges of the rings. The center of the ring however is a distance
of $1$ from the $y$-axis. This means that the distance from the center to the
edges is a distance from the axis of rotation to the $y$-axis (a distance of
$1$) and then from the $y$-axis to the edge of the rings.

So, the radii are then the functions plus $1$ and that is what makes this
example different from the previous example. Here we had to add the distance to
the function value whereas in the previous example we needed to subtract the
function from this distance. Note that without sketches the radii on these
problems can be difficult to get.

So, in summary, we've got the following for the inner and outer radius for this
example.

$$ \text{outer radius} = y + 1 + 1 = y + 2 $$

$$ \text{inner radius} = \frac{y^2}{4} + 1 + 1 = \frac{y^2}{4} + 2 $$

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(y) = \pi\left((y + 1)^2 - \left(\frac{y^2}{4} + 2\right)\right) = \pi\left(4y - \frac{y^4}{16}\right) $$

The first ring will occur at y=0 and the final ring will occur at $y = 4$ and so
these will be our limits of integration.

The volume is,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{0}^{4}{4y - \frac{y^4}{16}\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \pi\left(2y^2 - \frac{1}{80}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{4} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{96\pi}{5} $$

## Practice Problems

For each of the following problems use the method of disks/rings to determine
the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the given
curves about the given axis.

**1.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = \sqrt{x}$, $y = 3$ and the $y$-axis
about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

This is similar to Example 1 of the notes, except we are going about the
$y$-axis.

This means that we'll need to rewrite 9ur functions in terms of $y$:

$$ y = \sqrt{x} $$

$$ x = y^2 $$

Because we are rotating around the $y$-axis, we also note that this expresses
our radius.

$$ \text{Radius } = y^2 $$

The Area of a cross-sectional disk is then,

$$ A(y) = \pi\left(\text{Radius}\right)^2 = \pi\left(y^2\right)^2 = \pi y^4 $$

We can then use the Volume formula to find our answer:

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{f(y)\, dy} $$

By looking at the graph of the two functions, we can find that the first disk
occurs at $y = 0$, while the last disk occurs at $y = 3$. This is the limits of
our integral, $[0, 3]$.

$$ V = \int_{0}^{3}{\pi y^4\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi\int_{0}^{3}{y^4\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{3} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{5}(3)^5\right) - \left(\frac{1}{5}(0)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{\quad = \frac{243}{5}\pi} $$

**2.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 7 - x^2$ $x = -2$, $x = 2$ and the
$x$-axis about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

This is expressed for us in the proper form as we are oriented around the
$x$-axis, so functions must be in terms of $f(x)$. The radius is given to us in
the form of $y = 7 - x^2$. Thusly an Area of one of our disks is as follows:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(7 - x^2\right)^2 = \pi\left(49 - 14x^2 + x^4\right) $$

Taking our Volume formula gives us our answer, note that we are rotating around
the $x$-axis, and our bounds are given to us as $[-2, 2]$:

$$ V = \int_{-2}^{2}{\pi\left(49 - 14x^2 + x^4\right)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi\int_{-2}^{2}{49 - 14x^2 + x^4\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left. \left(49x - \frac{14}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{5}x^5\right) \right|_{-2}^{2} $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left[\left(49(2) - \frac{14}{3}(2)^3 + \frac{1}{5}(2)^5\right) - \left(49(-2) - \frac{14}{3}(-2)^3 + \frac{1}{5}(-2)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{\quad = \pi \left(\frac{2012}{15}\right)} $$

**3.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 6y + 10$ and $x = 5$ about the
$y$-axis.

**Solution**

We don't need to adjust our functions as they are given in terms of $f(y)$, and
they are oriented around the $y$-axis.

This essentially is a cylinder with a series of rings cut out of the center of
it.

The inner radius is defined by the given function $x = y^2 - 6y + 10$, while the
outer radius needs to be determined. We can determine that by finding where our
inner function meets our outer function.

$$ y^2 - 6y + 10 = 5 $$

$$ y^2 - 6y + 5 = 0 $$

$$ (y - 5)(y - 1) = 0 $$

$$ y = 1, y = 5 $$

By then plugging these into either of these functions, we get the following
intersection points:

$$ (5, 1), (5, 5) $$

These points represent where our cylinder begins and ends, and from that we can
see that the radius of the outer function is equal to $5$ (as both points show
it is $5$ units away from the center, the $y$-axis in this case).

We can now find the area of a sample cross-section by our Area formula for
rings:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(\text{outer radius}\right)^2 - \left(\text{inner radius}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left[(5)^2 - \left(y^2 - 6y + 10\right)^2\right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left[25 - \left(y^4 - 12y^3 + 56y^2 - 120y + 100\right)\right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left[-y^4 + 12y^3 - 56y^2 + 120y - 75\right] $$

And now take the Integral to find the Volume, note that our range is the
$y$-values of the intersection points we found earlier:

$$ V = \pi\int_{1}^{5}{-y^4 + 12y^3 - 56y^2 + 120y - 75\, dy} $$

$$ V = \left. \pi \left(-\frac{1}{5}y^5 + 3y^4 - \frac{56}{3}y^3 + 60y^2 - 75y\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(-\frac{1}{5}(5)^5 + 3(5)^4 - \frac{56}{3}(5)^3 + 60(5)^2 - 75(5)\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{5}(1)^5 + 3(1)^4 - \frac{56}{3}(1)^3 + 60(1)^2 - 75(1)\right)\right]$$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{1088}{15}\pi} $$

**4.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$ and $y = x^3$ about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $x$-axis, so these need to be in terms of $f(x)$,
which they already are.

First let's find where these two functions intersect specifically at the points,
this will help us determine the range of our integral later.

$$ 2x^2 = x^3 $$

$$ 2 = x $$

Now plug into one of the functions to find the $y$-coordinate.

$$ 2(2)^2 = 8 $$

Our first ring occurs at $[0, 0]$, and our last ring occurs at $[2, 8]$.

So our range goes up to $x = 2$, and starts at $y = 0$ (the $x$-axis).

We can see from the graph that the outermost radius is determined by $y = 2x^2$,
while the innermost radius is determined by $y = x^3$. So simply set up the
cross-sectional Area formula:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(\left(2x^2\right)^2 - \left(x^3\right)^2\right) $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(4x^4 - x^6\right) $$

And now take the Volume, note the range is from the $x$-coordinates of our the
first and last rings we found above.

$$ V = \pi\int_{0}^{2}{4x^4 - x^6\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left. \left(\frac{4}{5}x^5 -  \frac{1}{7}x^7\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left[\left(\frac{4}{5}(2)^5 -  \frac{1}{7}(2)^7\right) - \left(\frac{4}{5}(0)^5 -  \frac{1}{7}(0)^7\right) \right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left[\left(\frac{4}{5}(2)^5 -  \frac{1}{7}(2)^7\right) - \left(\frac{4}{5}(0)^5 -  \frac{1}{7}(0)^7\right) \right] $$

$$ \boxed{\quad = \frac{256}{35}\pi} $$

**5.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 6\mathbf{e}^{-2x}$ and
$y = 6 + 4x - 2x^2$ between $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ about the line $y = -2$.

**Solution**

Because these are rotated around an $x$-axis oriented axis (_i.e._ $y = -2$),
the given functions must be expressed in terms of $f(x)$, which they are and
therefore do not need to be expressed differently.

By looking at the graph of these two functions, we can see that the inner
function is $y = 6\mathbf{e}^{-2x}$, and the outer function is
$y = 6 + 4x - 2x^2$. The radius for both would just be those functions, but
because they are no longer oriented around $y = 0$ or the $x$-axis, we have to
adjust. In this case, we simply add $2$ to each radius.

$$ \text{Outer Radius } = 6 + 4x - 2x^2 + 2 = 8 + 4x - 2x^2 $$

$$ \text{Inner Radius} = 6\mathbf{e}^{-2x} + 2 $$

Thusly the formula for area still applies here:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[\left(8 + 4x - 2x^2\right)^2 - \left(6\mathbf{e}^{-2x} + 2\right)^2\right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi\left[4x^4 - 16x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x + 64 - \left(36\mathbf{e}^{-4x} + 24\mathbf{e}^{-2x} + 4\right) \right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi\left[4x^4 - 16x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x + 64 - 36\mathbf{e}^{-4x} - 24\mathbf{e}^{-2x} - 4\right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi\left[4x^4 - 16x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x + 60 - 36\mathbf{e}^{-4x} - 24\mathbf{e}^{-2x}\right] $$

Our range is given to us in this case in the problem statement of $x = 0$, and
$x = 1$.

So let's take our Volume Integral:

$$ V = \pi \int_{0}^{1}{4x^4 - 16x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x + 60 - 36\mathbf{e}^{-4x} - 24\mathbf{e}^{-2x}\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \pi \left. \left(\frac{4}{5}x^5 - 4x^4 - \frac{16}{3}x^3 + 32x^2 + 60x + 9\mathbf{e}^{-4x} + 12\mathbf{e}^{-2x}\right) \right|_{0}^{1} $$

$$
\begin{aligned}
V = \pi \cdot {} & \left(\frac{4}{5}(1)^5 - 4(1)^4
    - \frac{16}{3}(1)^3 + 32(1)^2 + 60(1)
    + 9\mathbf{e}^{-4(1)} + 12\mathbf{e}^{-2(1)}\right) \\
    & - \left(\frac{4}{5}(0)^5 - 4(0)^4 - \frac{16}{3}(0)^3
    + 32(0)^2 + 60(0) + 9\mathbf{e}^{-4(0)}
    + 12\mathbf{e}^{-2(0)}\right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
V = \pi \cdot {} & \left(\frac{4}{5} - 4
    - \frac{16}{3} + 32 + 60
    + 9\mathbf{e}^{-4} + 12\mathbf{e}^{-2}\right) \\
    & - \left(0 - 0 - 0
    + 0 + 0 + 9
    + 12\right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$ \boxed{V = \pi\left(\frac{937}{15} + 9\mathbf{e}^{-4} + 12\mathbf{e}^{-2}\right)} $$

**6.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 10 - 6x + x^2$, $y = -10 + 6x - x^2$,
$x = 1$ and $x = 5$ about the line $y = 8$.

**Solution**

These problems generally all follow a similar pattern.

1. Using the given bounds or setting the given functions equal to each other
   gives the limits of the integral.

2. The axis of rotation determines the form the given function(s) have to be in.
   Rotating around an $x$-axis (whether major or minor), have to be in terms of
   $f(x)$. Likewise if the axis of rotation is a form of the $y$-axis, then the
   terms have to be in $f(y)$.

3. The outer and inner radii are determined by the axis of rotation as well as
   which graph ends up on the "outside" of the shape created by the graphs.

4. The axis of rotation is either added or subtracted from the outer and inner
   functions to determine the radii. You'll have to look at the graphs to
   determine the logic.

5. The Area formula is simple enough to understand:

$$ A(xy) = \pi \left[\left(\text{O.R.}\right)^2 - \left(\text{I.R.}\right)^2\right] $$

6. The Integral is also easy enough to understand:

$$ V = \int_{\text{lim1}}^{\text{lim2}}{A(xy)\, dxy} $$

Let's solve this problem quickly then

Let's solve this problem quickly then.

Outer radius can be found looking at graph as being:

$$ y = -10 + 6x - x^2 $$

Adjust by the axis of rotation:

$$ \text{o.r. } = 8 - \left(-10 + 6x - x^2\right) $$

$$ \text{o.r. } = 8 + 10 - 6x + x^2 $$

$$ \text{o.r. } = 18 - 6x + x^2 $$

Inner radius:

$$ \text{i.r. } = 8 - \left(10 - 6x + x^2\right) $$

$$ \text{i.r. } = 8 - 10 + 6x - x^2 $$

$$ \text{i.r. } = -2 + 6x - x^2 $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[\left(18 - 6x + x^2\right)^2 - \left(-2 + 6x - x^2\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[\left(x^4 - 12x^3 + 72x^2 - 216x + 324\right) - \left(x^4 - 12x^3 + 40x^2 - 24x + 4\right)\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[x^4 - 12x^3 + 72x^2 - 216x + 324 - x^4 + 12x^3 - 40x^2 + 24x - 4\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[32x^2 - 192x + 320\right] $$

Limits:

$$ 1 \leq x \leq 5 $$

Volume:

$$ V = \int_{1}^{5}{\pi\left[32x^2 - 192x + 320\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(\frac{32}{3}x^3 - 96x^2 + 320x\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(\frac{32}{3}(5)^3 - 96(5)^2 + 320(5)\right) - \left(\frac{32}{3}(1)^3 - 96(1)^2 + 320(1)\right) \right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(\frac{32}{3}(125) - 96(25) + 320(5)\right) - \left(\frac{32}{3} - 96 + 320\right) \right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(\frac{4000}{3} - 2400 + 1600\right) - \left(\frac{32}{3} - 96 + 320\right) \right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\frac{4000}{3} - 2400 + 1600 - \frac{32}{3} + 96 - 320\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \pi\left(\frac{896}{3}\right)} $$

**7.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 4$ and $x = 6 - 3y$ about the
line $x = 24$.

**Solution**

Find intersection points:

$$ y^2 - 4 = 6 - 3y $$

$$ y^2 + 3y - 10 = 0 $$

$$ (y + 5)(y - 2) = 0 $$

$$ y = -5, y = 2 $$

$$ 6 - 3(-5) = 6 + 15 = 21 $$

$$ (21, -5) $$

$$ 6 - 3(2) = 0 $$

$$ (0, 2) $$

Intersection points: $(0, 2), (21, -5)$.

Find radii:

Normal:

Inner radius: $x = 6 - 3y$

Outer radius: $x = y^2 - 4$

Apply axis of rotation:

Inner Radius: $24 - (6 - 3y) = 18 + 3y $

Outer Radius: $24 - (y^2 - 4) = 24 - y^2 + 4 = 28 - y^2 $

Find Area:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(28 - y^2\right)^2 - \left(18 + 3y\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(y^4 - 56y^2 + 784\right) - \left(9y^2 + 108y + 324\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[y^4 - 56y^2 + 784 - 9y^2 - 108y - 324\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[y^4 - 65y^2 - 108y + 460\right] $$

Find Limits (based off of intersection):

$$ (21, -5), (0, 2) $$

$y$ values are limits.

$$ -5 \leq y \leq 2 $$

Find Volume:

$$ V = \int_{-5}^{2}{\pi\left[y^4 - 65y^2 - 108y + 460\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{5}y^5 - \frac{65}{3}y^3 - 54y^2 + 460y\right) \right|_{-5}^{2} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(\frac{32}{5} - \frac{520}{3} - 216 + 920\right) - \left(\frac{1}{5}(-5)^5 - \frac{65}{3}(-5)^3 - 54(-5)^2 + 460(-5)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(\frac{32}{5} - \frac{520}{3} - 216 + 920\right) - \left(-1 + \frac{8125}{3} - 1350 - 2300\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\frac{32}{5} - \frac{520}{3} - 216 + 920 + 1 - \frac{8125}{3} + 1350 + 2300\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \pi\left(\frac{31556}{15}\right)} $$

**8.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x + 1$, $x = 4$ and $y = 3$ about the
line $x = -4$.

**Solution**

Axis of rotation is about a $y$-axis, thusly must be in terms of $f(y)$, which
it isn't.

$$ y = 2x + 1 $$

$$ y - 1 = 2x $$

$$ \frac{y - 1}{2} = x $$

Outer radius prior to axis of rotation adjustment is:

$$ \text{o.r. } = 4 $$

Inner radius prior to axis of rotation adjustment is:

$$ \text{i.r. } = \frac{y - 1}{2} $$

Now adjust for axis of rotation:

$$ \text{o.r. } = 4 + 4 = 8 $$

$$ \text{i.r. } = 4 + \frac{y - 1}{2} = \frac{8 + y - 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}y + \frac{7}{2} $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[(8)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}y + \frac{7}{2}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[64 - \left(\frac{1}{4}y^2 + \frac{7}{2}y + \frac{49}{4}\right)\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[64 - \frac{1}{4}y^2 - \frac{7}{2}y - \frac{49}{4}\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[-\frac{1}{4}y^2 - \frac{7}{2}y + \frac{207}{4}\right] $$

Find limits:

First is $y = 3$. Second is: $2x + 1$ where $x = 4$:

$$ 2(4) + 1 = 9 $$

So our limits are:

$$ 3 \leq y \leq 9 $$

Find Volume:

$$ V = \int_{3}^{9}{\pi\left[-\frac{1}{4}y^2 - \frac{7}{2}y + \frac{207}{4}\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(-\frac{1}{12}y^3 - \frac{7}{4}y^2 + \frac{207}{4}y\right) \right|_{3}^{9} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(-\frac{1}{12}(9)^3 - \frac{7}{4}(9)^2 + \frac{207}{4}(9)\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{12}(3)^3 - \frac{7}{4}(3)^2 + \frac{207}{4}(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 126\pi $$

## Assignment Problems

For problems 1 - 16 use the method disks/rings to determine the volume of the
solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the given curves about the
given axis.

**1.** Rotate the region bounded by $y=2x^2$, $y=8$ and the $y$-axis about the
$y$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around the $y$-axis, the function(s) must be presented
in terms of $f(y)$, which they are not. Need to adjust.

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{y}{2} = x^2 $$

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{y}{2}} $$

This is our outer radius, the inner radius doesn't exist and therefore is $0$.

Find the area:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left(\sqrt{\frac{y}{2}}\right)^2 $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{y}{2}\pi $$

The limits are bound by the expression $y = 8$ and the corresponding
$x$-coordinate of the center of our shape:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Find the Volume:

$$ V = \frac{\pi}{2}\int_{0}^{8}{y\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{\pi}{2} \left. \left(\frac{1}{2}y^2\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \frac{\pi}{2}\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}(8)^2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{32\pi}{2} $$

$$ \boxed{V = 16\pi} $$

**2.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $y = 8$ and the $y$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around the $x$-axis this time, the shape changes to a
sort of spindel shape. The function $y = 2x^2$ is expressed as $f(x)$, and
because we are rotating around the $x$-axis, it can stay as this expression.

There is an inner function now expressed as $y = 2x^2$, while the outer radius
is determined by the "height" established by $y = 8$ function.

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[(8)^2 - \left(2x^2\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[64 - 4x^4\right] $$

The curve's bounded by the $y$-axis. Setting them equal, but omitting anything
lower than $y = 0$ will give us the limits.

$$ 2x^2 = 8 $$

$$ x^2 = 4 $$

$$ x = \pm 2 $$

But as said earlier, omit negative:

$$ x = 2 $$

So we are bounded:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

Find Volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{2}{\pi\left[64 - 4x^4\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(64x - \frac{4}{5}x^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(64(2) - \frac{4}{5}(2)^5\right) - \left(64(0) - \frac{4}{5}(0)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[128 - \frac{128}{5}\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512}{5}\pi} $$

**3.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $x = 2$ and the $x$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

The axis of rotation is the $x$-axis, thusly the terms must be in terms of
$f(x)$, which they are. The radius of the inner ring is the given boundary of
$y = 0$. The radius of the outer ring is the other function. Find Area:

$$ A(x) = 4\pi x^4$$

Limits are:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

Find Volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{2}{4x^4\pi\, dx} $$

$$ V = 4\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{5}x^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[\frac{1}{5}(2)^5 - \frac{1}{5}(0)^5\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left(\frac{32}{5}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{128}{5}\pi} $$

**4.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $x = 2$ and the $x$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

Because rotation is about $y$-axis, must be in terms of $f(y)$. Adjust:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ 2x^2 = y $$

$$ x^2 = \frac{1}{2}y $$

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

We are still bound by the $x$-axis, so we can omit the negative:

$$ x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

Radius of outer ring is is the given bound $x = 2$.

Radius of inner ring is given by found $x$:

$$ x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[(2)^2 - \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[4 - \frac{1}{2}y\right] $$

Limits are found by plugging in given $x = 2$ into $y = 2x^2$

$$ 2(2)^2 = 8 $$

We are bound by the other given limit $y = 0$.

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Find Volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{8}{\pi\left[4 - \frac{1}{2}y\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(4y - \frac{1}{4}y^2\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(4(8) - \frac{1}{4}(8)^2\right) - \left(4(0) - \frac{1}{4}(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[32 - 16\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 16\pi} $$

**5.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

All is expressed in terms of $f(y)$, but we are rotating around the $x$-axis,
thusly this needs to be expressed as $f(x)$.

$$ x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} $$

The outer radius is found by plugging in the given $x = 8$:

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2 $$

The inner radius is $0$, as the "inner" function is just the $x$-axis.

Find the area:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[\left(\sqrt[3]x\right)^2 - 0^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi x^{\frac{2}{3}} $$

The limits are given to us in $y = 0$(x-axis) and $x = 8$:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 8 $$

Volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{8}{\pi x^{\frac{2}{3}}\, dx} $$

In terms of $dx$, because rotating around $x$-axis.

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(\frac{3}{5}x^{\frac{5}{3}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(\frac{3}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{3}}\right) - \left(\frac{3}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{3}}\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{96}{5}\pi} $$

**6.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

All is expressed in terms of $f(y)$, we are rotating around the $y$-axis, all is
good in the world.

The outer function is simply $x = 8$. The inner function is $x = y^3$.

$$ A(y) = \pi \left[8^2 - \left(y^3\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi \left[64 - y^6\right] $$

The limits are defined by setting the boundary functions equal to our outer
function:

$$ y^3 = 8 $$

$$ y = 2 $$

$$ y^3 = 0 $$

$$ y = 0 $$

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

Volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{2}{\pi\left[64 - y^6\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(64y - \frac{1}{7}y^7\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(64(2) - \frac{1}{7}(2)^7\right) - \left(64(0) - \frac{1}{7}(0)^7\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[128 - \frac{128}{7}\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{768}{7}\pi} $$

**7.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $y = 2$ and the $y$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

All is expressed in terms of $f(y)$, but we are revolving around the $x$-axis,
so it should be expressed as $f(x)$.

$$ x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} $$

The boundaries are $y = 2$, the $y$-axis, $x = 0$, and the given function
$x = y^3$.

We are rotating around the $x$-axis, $y = 0$.

The outer radius is given to us as $y = 2$, the inner radius is the given
function boundary $x = y^3$, but we must express it as $f(x)$, in other words,
$y = \sqrt[3]{x}$.

Area:

$$ A(x) = \pi \left[(2)^2 - \left(\sqrt[3]{x}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi \left[4 - x^{\frac{2}{3}}\right] $$

The limits are found by understanding that we are rotating around the $x$-axis,
so thusly we must express our limits as they pertain to $x$. The innermost ring
occurs by plugging in our boundary $x = 0$ (the given $y$-axis boundary) into
our function:

$$ x = (0)^3 $$

$$ x = 0 $$

Our upper limit can be found by taking our other given boundary, $y = 2$ and
plugging it into our given boundary function $x = y^3$.

$$ x = (2)^3 $$

$$ x = 8 $$

Thusly our limits are:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 8 $$

Finally, volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{8}{\pi\left[4 - x^{\frac{2}{3}}\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(4x - \frac{3}{5}x^{\frac{5}{3}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(4(8) - \frac{3}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{3}}\right) - \left(4(0) - \frac{3}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{3}}\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{64}{5}\pi} $$

**8.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $y = 2$ and the $y$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $y$-axis, and all are in terms of $f(y)$, no need to
change expressions.

Our boundaries are:

$$ x = y^3 $$

$$ y = 2 $$

$$ x = 0 $$

Our inner radius is:

$$ x = 0 $$

Our outer radius is:

$$ x = y^3 $$

Our area is:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left((y^3)^2 - (0)^2\right) $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left(y^6\right) $$

Our limits are necessary to express as $y$ values because we are rotating around
the $y$-axis. They are given to us in the problem statement. $$ x = (0)^3 = 0 $$

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

Now finally volume:

$$ V = \pi\int_{0}^{2}{y^6\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{7}y^7\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{7}(2)^7\right) - \left(\frac{1}{7}(0)^7\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{128}{7}\pi} $$

**9.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = \dfrac{1}{x^2}$, $y = 9$, $x = -2$,
$x = -\dfrac{1}{3}$ about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $y$-axis, and all functions are expressions of
$f(x)$. Change that so it is $f(y)$.

$$ y = \frac{1}{x^2} $$

$$ yx^2 = 1 $$

$$ x^2 = \frac{1}{y} $$

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{y}} $$

Because we are bounded by $x = -2$ and $x = -\dfrac{1}{3}$, we omit the
positive.

$$ x = -\sqrt{\frac{1}{y}} $$

The outer radius is the given boundary:

$$ x = -2 $$

The inner radius is the innermost boundary:

$$ x = -\sqrt{\frac{1}{y}} $$

The area is then:

$$ A(y) = \pi \left[(-2)^2 - \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{y}}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi \left[4 - \frac{1}{y}\right] $$

We are integrating with respect to $y$. We plug in our given boundaries $x = -2$
and $x = -\dfrac{1}{3}$ into our boundary function $y = \dfrac{1}{x^2}$ to find
our limits of integration:

$$ y = \frac{1}{\left(-2\right)^2} = \frac{1}{4} $$

$$ y = \frac{1}{\left(-\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^2} = 9 $$

$$ \frac{1}{4} \leq y \leq 9 $$

Our Volume is then:

$$ V = \int_{\frac{1}{4}}^{9}{\pi\left(4 - \frac{1}{y}\right)\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(4y - \ln|y|\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{4}}^{9} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(4(9) - \ln|(9)|\right) - \left(4\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - \ln|\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)|\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(36 - \ln(9)\right) - \left(1 - \ln\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[36 - \ln(9) - 1 + \ln\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \pi \left[35 - \ln(9) + \ln\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\right]} $$

**10.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = \dfrac{1}{x^2}$, $y = 9$, $x = -2$,
$x = -\dfrac{1}{3}$ about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

We are revolving around the $x$-axis and the functions are given in terms of
$f(x)$. So no need to change anything.

The outer radius is then:

$$ y = 9 $$

The inner radius is then:

$$ y = \frac{1}{x^2} $$

The area is then:

$$ A(x) = \pi \left[(9)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi \left[81 - \frac{1}{x^4}\right] $$

The limits of integration must be in terms of $x$, and are given to us in the
problem statement.

$$ -2 \leq x \leq -\frac{1}{3} $$

Therefore our Volume is:

$$ V = \int_{-2}^{-\frac{1}{3}}{\pi\left[81 - \frac{1}{x^4}\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(81x + \frac{1}{3}x^{-3}\right) \right|_{-2}^{-\frac{1}{3}} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(81\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) + \frac{1}{3}\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^{-3}\right) - \left(81(-2) + \frac{1}{3}(-2)^{-3}\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{3025}{24}\pi} $$

**11.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}$, $y = 2$,
$x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and $x = 3$ about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $x$-axis and functions are expressions of $f(x)$, no
need to change.

Outer radius is:

$$ y = 4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} $$

Inner radius is:

$$ y = 2 $$

Area is therefore:

$$ A(x) = \pi \left[\left(4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right)^2 - (2)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi \left[16 + 24\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 9\mathbf{e}^{-2x} - 4\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi \left[12 + 24\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 9\mathbf{e}^{-2x}\right] $$

Limits of integration must be in terms of $x$, and are given to us as:

$$ \frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 3 $$

Volume is:

$$ V = \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{\pi\left[12 + 24\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 9\mathbf{e}^{-2x}\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(12x - 24\mathbf{e}^{-x} - \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-2x}\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(12(3) - 24\mathbf{e}^{-(3)} - \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-2(3)}\right) - \left(12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 24\mathbf{e}^{-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} - \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(36 - 24\mathbf{e}^{-3} - \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-6}\right) - \left(6 - 24\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-1}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[36 - 24\mathbf{e}^{-3} - \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-6} - 6 + 24\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-1}\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \pi \left[30 - 24\mathbf{e}^{-3} - \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-6} + 24\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{9}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-1}\right]} $$

**12.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = 5 - y^2$ and $x = 4$ about the
$y$-axis.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $y$-axis, so all must be in $f(y)$, which it is, no
need to adjust.

The outer radius is:

$$ x = 5 - y^2 $$

The inner radius is:

$$ x = 4 $$

The area is then:

$$ A(y) = \pi \left[\left(5 - y^2\right)^2 - (4)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi \left[y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 - 16\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi \left[y^4 - 10y^2 + 9\right] $$

The limits of integration must be in terms of $y$. We can plug our given $x$
into our boundary function to find them:

$$ 4 = 5 - y^2 $$

$$ -1 = -y^2 $$

$$ y^2 = 1 $$

$$ y = \pm 1 $$

So therefore our limits of integration are:

$$ -1 \leq y \leq 1 $$

We can now find our Volume:

$$ V = \int_{-1}^{1}{\pi\left[y^4 - 10y^2 + 9\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{5}y^5 - \frac{10}{3}y^3 + 9y\right) \right|_{-1}^{1} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(\frac{1}{5}(1)^5 - \frac{10}{3}(1)^3 + 9(1)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{5}(-1)^5 - \frac{10}{3}(-1)^3 + 9(-1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(\frac{1}{5} - \frac{10}{3} + 9\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{5} + \frac{10}{3} - 9\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\frac{1}{5} - \frac{10}{3} + 9 + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{10}{3} + 9\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{176}{15}\pi} $$

**13.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 6 - 2x$, $y = 3 + x$ and $x = 3$ about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

We are revolving around the $x$-axis, so our functions must be in terms of
$f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

The two functions appear to be equally far from the axis of rotation, checking
points will make it clear. Points to choose are determined by the boundary,
$x = 3$.

$$ y = 6 - 2(3) = 0 $$

$$ y = 3 + 3 = 6 $$

So $y = 6 - 2x$ is less than $y = 3 + x$, making $y = 3 + x$ further away
(greater) than $y = 6  - 2x$.

So our outer function is:

$$ y = 3 + x $$

And our inner function is:

$$ y = 6 - 2x $$

Our area is therefore:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[\left(3 + x\right)^2 - \left(6 - 2x\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[x^2 + 6x + 9 - \left(4x^2 - 24x + 36\right)\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[x^2 + 6x + 9 - 4x^2 + 24x - 36\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[-3x^2 + 30x - 27\right] $$

Our limits of integration must be in terms of $x$, which they are given by the
boundary $x = 3$ and where the two other boundary functions intersect.

$$ 6 - 2x = 3 + x $$

$$ 3 = 3x $$

$$ x = 1 $$

$$ 1 \leq x \leq 3 $$

The volume is:

$$ V = \int_{1}^{3}{\pi\left[-3x^2 + 30x - 27\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(-x^3 + 15x^2 - 27x\right) \right|_{1}^{3} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(-(3)^3 + 15(3)^2 - 27(3)\right) - \left(-(1)^3 + 15(1)^2 - 27(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[-27 + 135 - 81 - (-1 + 15 - 27)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[-27 + 135 - 81 + 1 - 15 + 27\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 40\pi} $$

**14.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 6 - 2x$, $y = 3 + x$ and $y = 6$ about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

The axis of rotation is the $y$-axis, all must be in terms of $f(y)$, we need to
adjust:

$$ y = 6 - 2x $$

$$ y - 6 = -2x $$

$$ 6 - y = 2x $$

$$ x = \frac{6 - y}{2} $$

$$ x = 3 - \frac{1}{2}y $$

$$ y = 3 + x $$

$$ x = y - 3 $$

Let's just use the plugging in of our boundary $y = 6$ to determine which is
outer vs. inner.

$$ x = 3 - \frac{1}{2}(6) = 0 $$

$$ x = (6) - 3 = 3 $$

So the outer function is:

$$ x = y - 3 $$

And the inner function is:

$$ x = 3 - \frac{1}{2}y $$

The Area function is:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[(y - 3)^2 - \left(3 - \frac{1}{2}y\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(y^2 - 6y + 9\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}y^2 - 3y + 9\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[y^2 - 6y + 9 - \frac{1}{4}y^2 + 3y - 9\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{3}{4}y^2 - 3y\right] $$

The limits of integration must be in terms of $y$, which we can get by the given
boundary, $y = 6$, and the other by setting the other two given boundary
functions equal to each other.

$$ y - 3 = 3 - \frac{1}{2}y $$

$$ y + \frac{1}{2}y = 6 $$

$$ \frac{3}{2}y = 6 $$

$$ y = 4 $$

$$ 4 \leq y \leq 6 $$

The volume is:

$$ V = \int_{4}^{6}{\pi\left[\frac{3}{4}y^2 - 3y\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{4}y^3 - \frac{3}{2}y^2\right) \right|_{4}^{6} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(6)^3 - \frac{3}{2}(6)^2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(4)^3 - \frac{3}{2}(4)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[(54 - 54) - (16 - 24)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi \left[-16 + 24\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 8\pi} $$

**15.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = x^2 - 2x + 4$ and $y = x + 14$ about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

We are revolving around the $x$-axis, so all functions must be expressed as
$f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are given no other boundaries, it is helpful to look at a graph to
get an idea of what the outer and inner functions are. Looking at the graph...

The outer function is:

$$ y = x + 14 $$

The inner function is:

$$ y = x^2 - 2x + 4 $$

The area function is:

$$A(x) = \pi \left[(x + 14)^2 - \left(x^2 - 2x + 4\right)^2\right]  $$

$$A(x) = \pi \left[\left(x^2 + 28x + 196\right) - \left(x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x + 16\right)\right]  $$

$$A(x) = \pi \left[x^2 + 28x + 196 - x^4 + 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 16x - 16\right]  $$

$$A(x) = \pi\left[4x^3 - x^4 - 11x^2 + 44x + 180\right] $$

We can find the limits of integration by setting the two functions equal to one
another.

$$ x + 14 = x^2 - 2x + 4 $$

$$ x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0 $$

$$ (x - 5)(x + 2) = 0 $$

$$ -2 \leq x \leq 5 $$

Our Volume is:

$$ V = \int_{-2}^{5}{\pi\left[4x^3 - x^4 - 11x^2 + 44x + 180\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(x^4 - \frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{11}{3}x^3 + 22x^2 + 180x\right) \right|_{-2}^{5} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left((5)^4 - \frac{1}{5}(5)^5 - \frac{11}{3}(5)^3 + 22(5)^2 + 180(5)\right) - \left((-2)^4 - \frac{1}{5}(-2)^5 - \frac{11}{3}(-2)^3 + 22(-2)^2 + 180(-2)\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{18179}{15}\pi} $$

**16.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = (y - 3)^2$ and $x = 16$ about the
$y$-axis.

**Solution**

We are revolving around the $y$-axis, so it must be in terms of $f(y)$, which
they are, no need to adjust.

The outer function is:

$$ x = 16 $$

The inner function is:

$$ x = (y - 3)^2 $$

The Area is:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[(16)^2 - \left((y - 3)^2\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[256 - \left(y^4 - 12y^3 + 54y^2 - 108y + 81\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[256 - y^4 + 12y^3 - 54y^2 + 108y - 81\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[12y^3 - y^4 - 54y^2 + 108y + 175\right] $$

The limits of integration can be found by setting the two given boundary
functions equal to each other.

$$ (y - 3)^2 = 16 $$

$$ y^2 - 6y + 9 = 16 $$

$$ y^2 - 6y - 7 = 0 $$

$$ (y + 1)(y - 7) = 0 $$

$$ -1 \leq y \leq 7 $$

The Volume:

$$ V = \int_{-1}^{7}{\pi\left[12y^3 - y^4 - 54y^2 + 108y + 175\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(3y^4 - \frac{1}{5}y^5 - 18y^3 + 54y^2 + 175y\right) \right|_{-1}^{7} $$

$$ V = \pi \left[\left(3(7)^4 - \frac{1}{5}(7)^5 - 18(7)^3 + 54(7)^2 + 175(7)\right) - \left(3(-1)^4 - \frac{1}{5}(-1)^5 - 18(-1)^3 + 54(-1)^2 + 175(-1)\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{8192}{5}\pi} $$

**17.** Use the method of disks/rings to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $y = 8$ and the $y$-axis
about the

**(a)** line $x = 3$

**Solution**

We are revolving around a minor $y$-axis, so expressions must be in terms of
$f(y)$. Let's adjust:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = x^2 $$

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

Because we are bounded by the $y$-axis, we can omit the negative:

$$ x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

The outer radius is :

$$ x = 3 - 0 $$

And the inner radius is:

$$ x = 3 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

Now we just work like usual, apply the Area formula:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[(3)^2 - \left(3 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[9 - \left(9 - 6\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} + \frac{1}{2}y\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[9 - 9 + 6\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} - \frac{1}{2}y\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[6\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} - \frac{1}{2}y\right] $$

Our limits of integration must be in terms of $y$:

We are given one of our limits at $y = 8$, and by plugging in our other limit
$x = 0$ into our given boundary function $y = 2x^2$, we'll get our other limit.

$$ y = 2(0)^2 = 0 $$

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Find the Volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{8}{\pi\left[6\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{1}{2}y\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(2y^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}y^2\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(2(8)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}(8)^2\right) - \left(2(0)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \pi\left(32\sqrt{2} - 16\right)} $$

**(b)** line $x = -2$

**Solution**

Very similar to (a), just the axis of rotation is $x = -2$.

The expression from part (a) still applies:

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

Because we are bounded by the $y$-axis, we can omit the positive this time:

$$ x = -\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

The outer radius is :

$$ x = (-2) - 0 = -2 $$

And the inner radius is:

$$ x = (-2) - \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y}\right) $$

$$ x = -2 + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

Area:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[(-2)^2 - \left(-2 + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[4 - \left(4 - 4\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} + \frac{1}{2}y\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[4 - 4 + 4\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} - \frac{1}{2}y\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[4\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} - \frac{1}{2}y\right] $$

Limits of integration are given and are the same as part (a):

$$ y = 2(0)^2 = 0 $$

$$ y = 8 $$

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Now find Volume:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{8}{\pi\left[4\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} - \frac{1}{2}y\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(\frac{4}{3}y^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}y^2\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(\frac{4}{3}(8)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}(8)^2\right) - \left(\frac{4}{3}(0)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \pi\left(\frac{64}{3}\sqrt{2} - 16\right)} $$

**\(c\)** line $y = 11$

**Solution**

Because the axis of rotation is now a minor $x$-axis, the originally given
expressions that are in terms of $f(x)$ are fine and don't need adjusting:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

The outer radius is:

$$ y = 11 - 2x^2 $$

And the inner radius is:

$$ y = 11 - 8 = 3 $$

Find the Area:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[\left(11 - 2x^2\right)^2 - (3)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[121 - 44x^2 + 4x^4 - 9\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[112 - 44x^2 + 4x^4\right] $$

The limits of integration must be expressions of $x$. In this case we can find
them by plugging in $y = 8$ into our given boundary function $y = 2x^2$:

$$ 8 = 2x^2 $$

$$ 4 = x^2 $$

$$ \pm 2 = x $$

$$ -2 \leq x \leq 2 $$

Now find the Volume:

$$ V = \int_{-2}^{2}{\pi\left[112 - 44x^2 + 4x^4\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(112x - \frac{44}{3}x^3 + \frac{4}{5}x^5\right) \right|_{-2}^{2} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(112(2) - \frac{44}{3}(2)^3 + \frac{4}{5}(2)^5\right) - \left(112(-2) - \frac{44}{3}(-2)^3 + \frac{4}{5}(-2)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(224 - \frac{352}{3} + \frac{128}{5}\right) - \left(-224 + \frac{352}{3} - \frac{128}{5}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[224 - \frac{352}{3} + \frac{128}{5} + 224 - \frac{352}{3} + \frac{128}{5}\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{2496}{5}\pi} $$

**(d)** line $y = -4$

**Solution**

Similar to part \(c\), we don't change the given boundary function:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

Note that we don't subtract from the axis of rotation value in this case because
the axis of rotation lies below both given functions $y = 2x^2$ and $y = 8$.
Instead we subtract the axis of rtation value from the given functions.

The outer function is:

$$ y = 8 - (-4) = 12 $$

The inner function is:

$$ y = 2x^2 - (-4) = 2x^2 + 4 $$

The area function is then:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[(12)^2 - \left(2x^2 + 4\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[144 - \left(4x^4 + 16x^2 + 16\right)\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[144 - 4x^4 - 16x^2 - 16\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[128 - 4x^4 - 16x^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = 4\pi\left[32 - x^4 - 4x^2\right] $$

The limits of integration are the same as part \(c\):

$$ -2 \leq x \leq 2 $$

Find the Volume:

$$ V = \int_{-2}^{2}{4\pi\left[32 - x^4 - 4x^2\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = 4\pi \left. \left(32x - \frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{4}{3}x^3\right) \right|_{-2}^{2} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[\left(32(2) - \frac{1}{5}(2)^5 - \frac{4}{3}(2)^3\right) - \left(32(-2) - \frac{1}{5}(-2)^5 - \frac{4}{3}(-2)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[\left(64 - \frac{32}{5} - \frac{32}{3}\right) - \left(-64 + \frac{32}{5} + \frac{32}{3}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[64 - \frac{32}{5} - \frac{32}{3} + 64 - \frac{32}{5} - \frac{32}{3}\right] $$

$$ V = 4\left(\frac{1408}{15}\right)\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{5632}{15}\pi} $$

**18.** Use the method of disks/rings to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 6y + 9$ and
$x = -y^2 + 6y - 1$ about the

**(a)** line $x = 10$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, all boundary functions must be
an expression of $f(y)$, which they are, so there's no need to adjust them.

The outer function is:

$$ x = 10 - \left(y^2 - 6y + 9\right) $$

$$ x = 10 - y^2 + 6y - 9 $$

$$ x = -y^2 + 6y + 1 $$

The inner function is:

$$ x = 10 - \left(-y^2 + 6y - 1\right) $$

$$ x = 10 + y^2 - 6y + 1 $$

$$ x = y^2 - 6y + 11 $$

Find the Area:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(-y^2 + 6y + 1\right)^2 - \left(y^2 - 6y + 11\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(y^4 - 12y^3 + 34y^2 + 12y + 1\right) - \left(y^4 - 12y^3 + 58y^2 - 132y + 121\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[y^4 - 12y^3 + 34y^2 + 12y + 1 - y^4 + 12y^3 - 58y^2 + 132y - 121\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[144y - 24y^2 - 120\right] $$

$$ A(y) = 24\pi\left[6y - y^2 - 5\right] $$

The limits of integration must be in terms of $y$. To find the limits of
integration, we will need to set the two functions equal to each other to find
the intersections and where the other boundary lies.

$$ y^2 - 6y + 9 = -y^2 + 6y - 1 $$

$$ 2y^2 - 12y + 10 = 0 $$

$$ y^2 - 6y + 5 = 0 $$

$$ (y - 1)(y - 5) = 0 $$

$$ y = 1 $$

$$ y = 5 $$

$$ 1 \leq y \leq 5 $$

Find the Volume:

$$ V = \int_{1}^{5}{24\pi\left[6y - y^2 - 5\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = 24\pi \left. \left(3y^2 - \frac{1}{3}y^3 - 5y\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = 24\pi \left[\left(3(5)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(5)^3 - 5(5)\right) - \left(3(1)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(1)^3 - 5(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 24\pi \left[\left(75 - \frac{125}{3} - 25\right) - \left(3 - \frac{1}{3} - 5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 24\pi \left[75 - \frac{125}{3} - 25 - 3 + \frac{1}{3} + 5\right] $$

$$ V = 24\left(\frac{32}{3}\right)\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = 256\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = -3$

**Solution**

Similar to part (a). We don't need to adjust our given functions as the axis of
rotation is still a minor $y$-axis.

The outer radius is:

$$ x = -y^2 + 6y - 1 - (-3) $$

$$ x = -y^2 + 6y + 2 $$

The inner radius is:

$$ x = y^2 - 6y + 9 - (-3) $$

$$ x = y^2 - 6y + 12 $$

The area is:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(-y^2 + 6y + 2\right)^2 - \left(y^2 - 6y + 12\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(y^4 - 12y^3 + 32y^2 + 24y + 4\right) - \left(y^4 - 12y^3 + 60y^2 - 144y + 144\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[y^4 - 12y^3 + 32y^2 + 24y + 4 - y^4 + 12y^3 - 60y^2 + 144y - 144\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[168y - 28y^2 - 140\right] $$

$$ A(y) = 28\pi\left[6y - y^2 - 5\right] $$

The limits of integration are the same as part (a):

$$ 1 \leq y \leq 5 $$

The Volume is:

$$ V = \int_{1}^{5}{28\pi\left[6y - y^2 - 5\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = 28\pi \left. \left(3y^2 - \frac{1}{3}y^3 - 5y\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = 28\pi \left[\left(3(5)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(5)^3 - 5(5)\right) - \left(3(1)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(1)^3 - 5(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 28\pi \left[\left(75 - \frac{125}{3} - 25\right) - \left(3 - \frac{1}{3} - 5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 28\pi \left[75 - \frac{125}{3} - 25 - 3 + \frac{1}{3} + 5\right] $$

$$ V = 28\left(\frac{32}{3}\right)\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{896}{3}\pi} $$

**19.** Use the method of disks/rings to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the triangle with vertices $(3, 2)$, $(7, 2)$ and $(7, 14)$
about the

**(a)** line $x = 12$

**Solution**

The horizontal and vertical lines of the triangle are easy enough to express:

$$ y = 2 $$

$$ x = 7 $$

The hypotenuse requires some old school algebra. Recall the standard slope
formula:

$$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

In this case this means our slope of the hypotenuse is:

$$ m = \frac{14 - 2}{7 - 3} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 $$

The equation through the initial point of the hypotenuse, $(3, 2)$ is:

$$ y - 2 = 3(x - 3) \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 3x - 7 $$

Now we have our boundary functions and can treat this like the problems we've
had earlier.

Since our axis of rotation is $x = 12$, this is in terms of $f(y)$ and thusly
our hypotenuse boundary function will have to be adjusted to reflect this:

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

$$ y + 7  = 3x $$

$$ x = \frac{y + 7}{3} $$

Our outer function is this hypotenuse boundary subtracted from the axis of
rotation's value:

$$ x = 12 - \frac{y + 7}{3} $$

And our inner function is the axis of rotation's value minus the boundary
function $x = 7$:

$$ x = 12 - 7 = 5 $$

Find the area:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(12 - \frac{y + 7}{3}\right)^2 - (5)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\left(\frac{y^2 - 58y + 841}{9}\right) - 25\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{y^2 - 58y + 841 - 225}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{y^2 - 58y + 616}{9}\right] $$

The limits of integration must be in terms of $y$. One of them is given to us in
the form of $y = 2$ , the other will have to be found by plugging in $7$ into
the hypotenuse function:

$$ 7 = \frac{y + 7}{3} $$

$$ 21 = y + 7 $$

$$ y = 14 $$

$$ 2 \leq y \leq 14 $$

Finally, get the Volume:

$$ V = \int_{2}^{14}{\pi\left[\frac{y^2 - 58y + 616}{9}\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{3}y^3 - 29y^2 + 616y\right) \right|_{2}^{14} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(14)^3 - 29(14)^2 + 616(14)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - 29(2)^2 + 616(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[\left(\frac{2744}{3} - 5684 + 8624\right) - \left(\frac{8}{3} - 116 + 1232\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[\frac{2744}{3} - 5684 + 8624 - \frac{8}{3} + 116 - 1232\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2736}{9}\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = 304\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = 2$

**Solution**

The expression of our hypotenuse remains the same from part (a):

$$ x = \frac{y + 7}{3} $$

The limits of integration remain the same from part (a):

$$ 2 \leq y \leq 14 $$

Plugging in a value within this range to our hypotenuse yields a value less than
or equal to the other given boundary $y = 7$, thusly the outer function is:

$$ x = 7 - 2 = 5 $$

And our inner function is:

$$ x = \frac{y + 7}{3} - 2 $$

The area:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[(5)^2 - \left(\frac{y + 7}{3} - 2\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[25 - \frac{y^2 + 2y + 1}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{225 - \left(y^2 + 2y + 1\right)}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{225 - y^2 - 2y - 1}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{-y^2 - 2y + 224}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[-y^2 - 2y + 224\right] $$

The Volume:

$$ V = \int_{2}^{14}{\frac{1}{9}\pi\left[-y^2 - 2y + 224\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi \left. \left(-\frac{1}{3}y^3 - y^2 + 224y\right) \right|_{2}^{14} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[\left(-\frac{1}{3}(14)^3 - (14)^2 + 224(14)\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - (2)^2 + 224(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[\left(-\frac{2744}{3} - 196 + 3136\right) - \left(-\frac{8}{3} - 4 + 448\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[-\frac{2744}{3} - 196 + 3136 + \frac{8}{3} + 4 - 448\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1584}{9}\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = 176\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $x = -1$

**Solution**

Very similar to part (b), the axis of rotation is just moved a bit more to the
left.

The expression of the hypotenuse is the same:

$$ x = \frac{y + 7}{3} $$

The limits of integration remain the same from part (a):

$$ 2 \leq y \leq 14 $$

The outer and inner functions are the same, just adjusted for the new axis of
rotation.

Outer function

$$ x = 7 - (-1) = 8 $$

And our inner function is:

$$ x = \frac{y + 7}{3} - (-1) = \frac{y + 7}{3} + 1 = \frac{y + 10}{3} $$

The area:

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[(8)^2 - \left(\frac{y + 10}{3}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[64 - \left(\frac{y^2 + 20y + 100}{9}\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{576 - \left(y^2 + 20y + 100\right)}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{576 - y^2 - 20y - 100}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \pi\left[\frac{-y^2 - 20y + 476}{9}\right] $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[-y^2 - 20y + 476\right] $$

The Volume:

$$ V = \int_{2}^{14}{\frac{1}{9}\pi\left[-y^2 - 20y + 476\right]\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi \left. \left(-\frac{1}{3}y^3 - 10y^2 + 476y\right) \right|_{2}^{14} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[\left(-\frac{1}{3}(14)^3 - 10(14)^2 + 476(14)\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - 10(2)^2 + 476(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[\left(-\frac{2744}{3} - 1960 + 6664\right) - \left(-\frac{8}{3} - 40 + 952\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{9}\pi\left[-\frac{2744}{3} - 1960 + 6664 + \frac{8}{3} + 40 - 952\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 320\pi} $$

**(d)** line $y = 14$

**Solution**

Since we are now rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our expression of the
hypotenuse in terms of $f(x)$ is now fine:

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

The limits of our integration must be in terms of $x$. One of our boundary
limits is given to us in terms of $x = 3$ and $x = 7$:

$$ 3 \leq x \leq 7 $$

By taking a value in this range and plugging it into our hypotenuse function, we
can compare it to $x = 7$ to see which is the outer/inner radii.

$$ y = 3(4) - 7 = 5 $$

This is less and thusly the inner function. Now we just have to subtract the
functions from the value of the axis of rotation:

inner function:

$$ y = 14 - (3x - 7) $$

$$ y = 14 - 3x + 7 $$

$$ y = -3x + 21 $$

outer function:

$$ y = 14 - 2 = 12 $$

Now find the area:

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[(12)^2 - (-3x + 21)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[144 - (9x^2 - 126x + 441)\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[144 - 9x^2 + 126x - 441\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[-9x^2 + 126x - 297\right] $$

Volume:

$$ V = \int_{3}^{7}{\pi\left[-9x^2 + 126x - 297\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(-3x^3 + 63x^2 - 297x\right) \right|_{3}^{7} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(-3(7)^3 + 63(7)^2 - 297(7)\right) - \left(-3(3)^3 + 63(3)^2 - 297(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 384\pi} $$

**(e)** line $y = 1$

**Solution**

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

$$ 3 \leq x \leq 7 $$

outer function:

$$ y = (3x - 7) - 1 $$

$$ y = 3x - 8 $$

inner function:

$$ y = 2 - 1 = 1 $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[(3x - 8)^2 - 1^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[9x^2 - 48x + 63\right] $$

$$ V = \int_{3}^{7}{\pi\left[9x^2 - 48x + 63\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi \left. \left(3x^3 - 24x^2 + 63x\right) \right|_{3}^{7} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(3(7)^3 - 24(7)^2 + 63(7)\right) - \left(3(3)^3 - 24(3)^2 + 63(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 240\pi} $$

**(f)** line $y = -3$

**Solution**

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

$$ 3 \leq x \leq 7 $$

outer function:

$$ y = (3x - 7) - (-1) $$

$$ y = 3x - 6 $$

inner function:

$$ y = 2 - (-1) = 3 $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[(3x - 6)^2 - (3)^2\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[(9x^2 - 36x + 36) - 9\right] $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left[9x^2 - 36x + 27\right] $$

$$ A(x) = 9\pi\left[x^2 - 4x + 3\right] $$

$$ V = \int_{3}^{7}{9\pi\left[x^2 - 4x + 3\right]\, dx} $$

$$ V = 9\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x\right) \right|_{3}^{7} $$

$$ V = 9\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(7)^3 - 2(7)^2 + 3(7)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(3)^3 - 2(3)^2 + 3(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 9\left(\frac{112}{3}\right)\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = 336\pi} $$
