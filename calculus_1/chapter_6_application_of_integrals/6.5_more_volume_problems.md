# Section 6.5 : More Volume Problems

In this section we're going to take a look at some more volume problems.
However, the problems we'll be looking at here will not be solids of revolution
as we looked at in the previous two sections. There are many solids out there
that cannot be generated as solids of revolution, or at least not easily and so
we need to take a look at how to do some of these problems.

Now, having said that these will not be solids of revolutions they will still be
worked in pretty much the same manner. For each solid we'll need to determine
the cross-sectional area, either $A(x)$ or $A(y)$, and they use the formulas we
used in the previous two sections,

> $$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} \quad \quad V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

The "hard" part of these problems will be determining what the cross-sectional
area for each solid is. Each problem will be different and so each
cross-sectional area will be determined by different means.

Also, before we proceed with any examples we need to acknowledge that the
integrals in this section might look a little tricky at first. There are going
to be very few numbers in these problems. All of the examples in this section
are going to be more general derivation of volume formulas for certain solids.
As such we'll be working with things like circles of radius $r$ and we'll not be
giving a specific value of $r$ and we'll have heights of $h$ instead of specific
heights, etc.

All the letters in the integrals are going to make the integrals look a little
tricky, but all you have to remember is that the $r$'s and the $h$'s are just
letters being used to represent a fixed quantity for the problem, _i.e._ it is a
constant. So, when we integrate we only need to worry about the letter in the
differential as that is the variable we're actually integrating with respect to.
All other letters in the integral should be thought of as constants. If you have
trouble doing that, just think about what you'd do if the $r$ was a $2$ or the
$h$ was a $3$ for example.

Let's start with a simple example that we don't actually need to do an integral
that will illustrate how these problems work in general and will get us used to
seeing multiple letters in integrals.

---

**Example 1** Find the volume of a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $h$.

**Solution**

Now, as we mentioned before starting this example we really don't need to use an
integral to find this volume, but it is a good example to illustrate the method
we'll need to use for these types of problems.

We'll start off with the sketch of the cylinder below.

![image 6.5_1](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image001.gif)

We'll center the cylinder on the $x$-axis and the cylinder will start at $x = 0$
and end at $x = h$ as shown. Note that we're only choosing this particular set
up to get an integral in terms of $x$ and to make the limits nice to deal with.
There are many other orientations that we could use.

What we need here is to get a formula for the cross-sectional area at any $x$.
In this case the cross-sectional area is constant and will be a disk of radius
$r$. Therefore, for any $x$ we'll have the following cross-sectional area,

$$ A(x) = \pi r^2 $$

Next the limits for the integral will be $0 \leq x \leq h$ xince that is the
range of $x$ in which the cylinder lives. Here is the integral for the volume,

$$ V = \int_{0}^{h}{\pi r^2\, dx} = \pi r^2\int_{0}^{h}{\, dx} = \pi r^2x\left. \right|_{0}^{h} = \pi r^2h $$

So, we get the expected formula.

Also, recall we are using $r$ to represent the radius of the cylinder. While $r$
can clearly take different values it will never change once we start the
problem. Cylinders do not change their radius in the middle of a problem and so
as we move along the center of the cylinder (_i.e._ the $x$-axis) $r$ is a fixed
number and won't change. In other words, it is a constant that will not change
as we change the $x$. Therefore, because we integrated with respect to $x$ the
$r$ will be a constant as far as the integral is concerned. The $r$ can then be
pulled out of the integral as shown (although that's not required, we just did
it to make the point). At this point we're just integrating $dx$ and we know how
to do that.

When we evaluate the integral remember that the limits are $x$ values and so we
plug into the $x$ and NOT the $r$. Again, remember that $r$ is just a letter
that is being used to represent the radius of the cylinder and, once we start
the integration, is assumed to be a fixed constant.

As noted before we started this example if you're having trouble with the $r$
just think of what you'd do if there was a $2$ there instead of an $r$. In this
problem, because we're integrating with respect to $x$, both the $2$ and the $r$
will behave in the same manner. Note however that you should NEVER actually
replace the $r$ with a $2$ as that WILL lead to a wrong answer. You should just
think of what you would do IF the $r$ was a $2$.

---

So, to work these problems we'll first need to get a sketch of the solid with a
set of $x$ and $y$ axes to help us see what's going on. At the very least we'll
need the sketch to get the limits of the integral, but we will often need it to
see just what the cross-sectional area is. Once we have the sketch we'll need to
determine a formula for the cross-sectional area and then do the integral.

Let's work a couple of more complicated examples. In these examples the main
issue is going to be determining what the cross-sectional areas are.

---

**Example 2** Find the volume of a pyramid whose base is a square with sides of
length $L$ and whose height is $h$.

**Solution**

Let's start off with a sketch of the pyramid. In this case we'll center the
pyramid on the $y$-axis and to make the equations easier we are going to
position the point of the pyramid at the origin.

![image 6.5_2](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image002.gif)

Now, as shown here the cross-sectional area will be a function of $y$ and it
will also be a square with sides of length $s$. The area of the square is easy,
but we'll need to get the length of the side in terms of $y$. To determine this,
consider the figure on the right above. If we look at the pyramid directly from
the front we'll see that we have two similar triangles and we know that the
ratio of any two sides of similar triangles must be equal. In other words, we
know that,

$$ \frac{s}{L} = \frac{y}{h} \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{y}{h}L = \frac{L}{h}y $$

So, the cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(y) = s^2 = \frac{L^2}{h^2}y^2 $$

The limit for the integral will be $0 \leq y \leq h$ and the volume will be,

$$ V = \int_{0}^{h}{\frac{L^2}{h^2}y^2\, dy} = \frac{L^2}{h^2}\int_{0}^{h}{y^2\, dy} = \left. \frac{L^2}{h^2}\left(\frac{1}{3}y^3\right) \right|_{0}^{h} = \frac{1}{3}L^2h $$

Again, do not get excited about the $L$ and the $h$ in the integral. Once we
start the problem if we change $y$ they will not change and so they are
constants as far as the integral is concerned and can get pulled out of the
integral. Also, remember that when we evaluate will only plug the limits into
the variable we integrated with respect to, $y$ in this case.

---

Before we proceed with some more complicated examples we should once again
remind you to not get excited about the other letters in the integrals. If we're
integrating with respect to $x$ or $y$ then all other letters in the formula
that represent fixed quantities (_i.e._ radius, height, length of a side,
_etc._) are just constants and can be treated as such when doing the integral.

Now let's do some more examples.

---

**Example 3** For a sphere of radius $r$ find the volume of the cap of height
$h$.

**Solution**

A sketch is probably best to illustrate what we're after here.

![image 6.5_3](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image003.gif)

We are after the top portion of the sphere and the height of this is portion is
h. In this case we'll use a cross-sectional area that starts at the bottom of
the cap, which is at $y = r - h$, and moves up towards the top, which is at
$y = r$. So, each cross-section will be a disk of radius $x$. It is a little
easier to see that the radius will be $x$ if we look at it from the top as shown
in the sketch to the right above. The area of this disk is then,

$$ \pi x^2 $$

This is a problem however as we need the cross-sectional area in terms of $y$.
So, what we really need to determine what $x^2$ will be for any given $y$ at the
cross-section. To get this let's look at the sphere from the front.

![image 6.5_4](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image004.gif)

In particular look at the triangle POR. Because the point $R$ lies on the sphere
itself we can see that the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle (the line
OR) is $r$, the radius of the sphere. The line PR has a length of $x$ and the
line OP has length $y$ so by the Pythagorean Theorem we know,

$$ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = r^2 - y^2 $$

So, we now know what $x^2$ will be for any given $y$ and so the cross-sectional
area is,

$$ A(y) = \pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right) $$

As we noted earlier the limits on $y$ will be $r - h \leq y \leq r$ and so the
volume is,

$$ V = \int_{r - h}^{r}{\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)\, dy} = \pi \left. \left(r^2y - \frac{1}{3}y^3\right) \right|_{r - h}^{r} = \pi\left(h^2r - \frac{1}{3}h^3\right) = \pi h^2\left(r - \frac{1}{3}h\right) $$

---

In the previous example we again saw an $r$ in the integral. However, unlike the
previous two examples it was not multiplied times the $x$ or the $y$ and so
could not be pulled out of the integral. In this case it was like we were
integrating $4 - y^2$ and we know how to integrate that. So, in this case we
need to treat the $r^2$ like the $4$ and so when we integrate that we'll pick up
a $y$.

---

**Example 4** Find the volume of a wedge cut out of a cylinder of radius $r$ if
the angle between the top and bottom of the wedge is $\dfrac{\pi}{6}$.

**Solution**

We should really start off with a sketch of just what we're looking for here.

![image 6.5_5](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image005.gif)

On the left we see how the wedge is being cut out of the cylinder. The base of
the cylinder is the circle give by $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ and the angle between this
circle and the top of the wedge is $\dfrac{\pi}{6}$. The sketch in the upper
right position is the actual wedge itself. Given the orientation of the axes
here we get the portion of the circle with positive $y$ and so we can write the
equation of the circle as $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$ since we only need the positive
$y$ values. Note as well that this is the reason for the way we oritented the
axes here. We get positive $y$'s and we can write the equation of the circle as
a function only of $x$'s.

Now, as we can see in the two sketches of the wedge the cross-section area will
be a right triangle and the area will be a function of $x$ as we move from the
back of the cylinder, at $x = -r$, to the front of the cylinder, at $x = r$.

The right angle of the triangle will be on the circle itself while the point on
the $x$-axis will have an interior angle of $\dfrac{\pi}{6}$. The base of the
triangle will have a length of $y$ and using a little right triangle trig we see
that the height of the rectangle is,

$$ \text{height} = y\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}y $$

So, we now know the base and height of our triangle, in terms of $y$, and we
have an equation for $y$ in terms of $x$ and so we can see that the area of the
triangle, _i.e._ the cross‑sectional area is,

$$ A(x) = \frac{1}{2}(y)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}y\right) = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\left(r^2 - x^2\right) $$

The limits on $x$ are $-r \leq x \leq r$ and so the volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{-r}^{r}{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\left(r^2 - x^2\right)\, dx} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\left. \left(r^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3\right) \right|_{-r}^{r} = \frac{2r^3}{3\sqrt{3}} $$

---

The next example is very similar to the previous one except it can be a little
difficult to visualize the solid itself.

---

**Example 5** Find the volume of the solid whose base is a disk of radius $r$
and whose cross-sections are equilateral triangles.

**Solution**

Let's start off with a couple of sketches of this solid. The sketch on the left
is from the "front" of the solid and the sketch on the right is more from the
top of the solid.

![image 6.5_6](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image006.gif)

The base of this solid is the disk of radius r and we move from the back of the
disk at $x = -r$ to the front of the disk at $x = r$ we form equilateral
triangles to form the solid. A sample equilateral triangle, which is also the
cross-sectional area, is shown above to hopefully make it a little clearer how
the solid is formed.

Now, let's get a formula for the cross-sectional area. Let's start with the two
sketches below.

![image 6.5_7](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image007.gif)

In the left hand sketch we are looking at the solid from directly above and
notice that we "reoriented" the sketch a little to put the $x$ and $y$-axis in
the "normal" orientation. The solid vertical line in this sketch is the
cross-sectional area. From this we can see that the cross-section occurs at a
given $x$ and the top half will have a length of $y$ where the value of $y$ will
be the $y$-coordinate of the point on the circle and so is,

$$ y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} $$

Also, because the cross-section is an equilateral triangle that is centered on
the $x$-axis the bottom half will also have a length of $y$. Thus, the base of
the cross-section must have a length of $2y$.

The sketch to the right is of one of the cross-sections. As noted above the base
of the triangle has a length of $2y$. Also note that because it is an
equilateral triangle the angles are all $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$. If we divide the
cross-section in two (as shown with the dashed line) we now have two right
triangles and using right triangle trig we can see that the length of the dashed
line is,

$$ \text{dashed line} = y\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}y $$

Therefore, the height of the cross-section is $\sqrt{3}y$. Because the
cross-section is a triangle we know that that it's area must then be,

$$ A(x) = \frac{1}{2}(2y)\left(\sqrt{3}y\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(2\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right)\left(\sqrt{3}\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right) = \sqrt{3}\left(r^2 - x^2\right) $$

Note that we used the cross-sectional area in terms of $x$ because each of the
cross-sections is perpendicular to the $x$-axis and this pretty much forces us
to integrate with respect to $x$.

The volume of the solid is then,

$$ V(x) = \int_{-r}^{r}{\sqrt{3}\left(r^2 - x^2\right)\, dx} = \sqrt{3} \left. \left(r^2x - \frac{1}{3}x^3\right) \right|_{-r}^{r} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}r^3 $$

---

The final example we're going to work here is a little tricky both in seeing how
to set it up and in doing the integral.

---

**Example 6** Find the volume of a torus with radii $r$ and $R$.

**Solution**

First, just what is a torus? A torus is a donut shaped solid that is generated
by rotating the circle of radius $r$ and centered at $(R, 0)$ about the
$y$-axis. This is shown in the sketch to the left below.

![image 6.5_8](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image008.gif)

One of the trickiest parts of this problem is seeing what the cross-sectional
area needs to be. There is an obvious one. Most people would probably think of
using the circle of radius $r$ that we're rotating about the $y$-axis as the
cross-section. It is definitely one of the more obvious choices, however setting
up an integral using this is not so easy.

So, what we'll do is use a cross-section as shown in the sketch to the right
above. If we cut the torus perpendicular to the $y$-axis we'll get a
cross-section of a ring and finding the area of that shouldn't be too bad. To do
that let's take a look at the two sketches below.

![image 6.5_9](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image009.gif)

The sketch to the left is a sketch of the full cross-section. The sketch to the
right is more important however. This is a sketch of the circle that we are
rotating about the $y$-axis. Included is a line representing where the
cross-sectional area would be in the torus.

Notice that the inner radius will always be the left portion of the circle and
the outer radius will always be the right portion of the circle. Now, we know
that the equation of this is,

$$ \left(x - R\right)^2 + y^2 = r^2 $$

and so if we solve for $x$ we can get the equations for the left and right sides
as shown above in the sketch. This however means that we also now have equations
for the inner and outer radii.

$$ \text{inner radius : } x = R - \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} \quad \quad \text{outer radius : } x = R + \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} $$

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(y) = \pi\left(\text{outer radius}\right)^2 - \pi\left(\text{inner radius}\right)^2 $$

$$ \quad = \pi\left[\left(R + \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\right)^2 - \left(R - \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\right)^2\right] $$

$$ \quad = \pi\left[R^2 + 2R\sqrt{r^2 - y^2} + r^2 - y^2 - \left(R^2 - 2R\sqrt{r^2 - y^2} + r^2 - y^2\right)\right] $$

$$ 4\pi R\sqrt{r^2 - y^2} $$

Next, the lowest cross-section will occur at $y = -r$ and the highest
cross-section will occur at $y = r$ and so the limits for the integral will be
$-r \leq y \leq r$.

The integral giving the volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{-r}^{r}{4\pi R\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\, dy} = 2\int_{0}^{r}{4\pi R\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\, dy} = 8\pi R\int_{0}^{r}{\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\, dy} $$

Note that we used the fact that because the integrand is an even function and
we’re integrating over $[-r, r]$ we could change the lower limit to zero and
double the value of the integral. We saw this fact back in the
[**Computing Definite Integrals**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ComputingDefiniteIntegrals.aspx#Int_SubDef_EvenOdd)
section.

We've now reached the second really tricky part of this example. With the
knowledge that we've currently got at this point this integral is not possible
to do. It requires something called a
[**trig substitution**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/TrigSubstitutions.aspx)
and that is a topic for Calculus II. Luckily enough for us, and this is the
tricky part, in this case we can actually determine the integral's value using
what we know about integrals.

Just for a second let's think about a different problem. Let's suppose we wanted
to use an integral to determine the area under the portion of the circle of
radius $r$ and centered at the origin that is in the first quadrant. There are a
couple of ways to do this, but to match what we're doing here let's do the
following.

We know that the equation of the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ and if we solve for
$x$ the equation of the circle in the first (and fourth for that matter)
quadrant is,

$$ x = \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} $$

If we want an integral for the area in the first quadrant we can think of this
area as the region between the curve $x = \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}$ and the $y$-axis for
$0 \leq y \leq r$ and this is,

$$ A = \int_{0}^{r}{\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\, dy} $$

In other words, this integral represents one quarter of the area of a circle of
radius $r$ and from basic geometric formulas we now know that this integral must
have the value,

$$ A = \int_{0}^{r}{\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\, dy} = \frac{1}{4}\pi r^2 $$

So, putting all this together the volume of the torus is then,

$$ V = 8R\pi\int_{0}^{r}{\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\, dy} = 8\pi R\left(\frac{1}{4}\pi r^2\right) = 2R\pi^2 r^2 $$

---

## Practice Problems

**1.** Find the volume of a pyramid of height h whose base is an equilateral
triangle of length $L$.

**Solution**

If we establish the cross section of the triangle as having three sides all of
equal length of $s$ and a height of $y$. We also know that each angle of the
equilateral triangle to be $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$. If we then bisect this cross
section down the middle, we get two right triangles with an unknown height $h$
splitting it down the middle. Since we need to solve for $h$ here in terms of
$s$ we get:

$$ \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{h}{\dfrac{s}{2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{s}{2}\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s $$

We know that the standard area of a triangle is:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}bh $$

Let's fill in now for this particular cross-section:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}(s)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 $$

Now, we need to express this Area, $A$, in terms of $y$, _i.e._ $A(y)$. This
means we need to establish a relationship between $s$ and $y$.

We know that the largest side that the pyramid can have is $L$ and that the
largest height it can have is in $h$. We also know the ratio of the cross
sections always remain the same, with the specific cross section having
corresponding sides of $s$ and corresponding heights of $y$. Thusly we get:

$$ \frac{s}{y} = \frac{L}{h} \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{L}{h}y $$

This gives us what we need to express $A$ in terms of $A(y)$:

$$ A(y) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\left(\frac{L}{h}y\right)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}L^2}{4h^2}y^2 $$

Let's re-establish that the standard Volume formula we've used in the previous
two sections is generally:

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

We know that at the "top" of the pyramid, $y = 0$ and at the "bottom" of the
pyramid, $y = h$. This establishes our limits of integration as:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq h $$

From here, we can now solve this problem by plugging everything into the Volume
formula:

$$ V = \int_{0}^{h}{\frac{\sqrt{3}L^2}{4h^2}y^2\, dy} = \frac{\sqrt{3}L^2}{4h^2}\int_{0}^{h}{y^2\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{\sqrt{3}L^2}{4h^2} \left. \left(\frac{1}{3}y^3\right) \right|_{0}^{h} $$

$$ V = \frac{\sqrt{3}L^2}{4h^2} \left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(h)^3\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(0)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{\sqrt{3}L^2h^3}{12h^2} $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{\sqrt{3}L^2h}{12}} $$

**2.** Find the volume of the solid whose base is a disk of radius $r$ and whose
cross-sections are squares. See figure below to see a sketch of the
cross-sections.

![image 6.5_10](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/CalcI/MoreVolume_Files/image001.gif)

**Solution**

Because the cross-sections are perpendicular to the $y$-axis, the Area function
must be expressed in terms of $A(y)$.

The width of the square cross-section ranges from $x = -\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}$ to
$x = \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}$ along the $y$-axis.

We'll need to establish a constant that represents the sides of the square
cross-sections, let's simply call it $s$.

We know that if we express the sides of our square in this way, that the area of
a square is simply:

$$ A = s^2 $$

But, of course, we need our Area in terms of $A(y)$, so we'll have to establish
a relationship between $s$ and $y$. We know that when oriented around the
$y$-axis, the middle of the division of the square establishes two rectangles
each with two sides of $s$ and two sides of $\dfrac{s}{2}$ in length. We also
established that each of those sides ranged from $x = -\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}$ and
$x = \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}$. This creates the relationship of:

$$ \frac{s}{2} = \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = 2\sqrt{r^2 -y^2} $$

Thusly we have our $A(y)$:

$$ A(y) = s^2 = \left(2\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}\right)^2 = 4\left(r^2 - y^2\right) $$

We can determine our limits of integration by noting that the first
cross-section will occur at $y = -r$ and will end at $y = r$, so our limits of
integration are:

$$ -r \leq y \leq r $$

Finally we can find our Volume:

$$ V = \int_{-r}^{r}{4\left(r^2 - y^2\right)\, dy} = 4\int_{-r}^{r}{\left(r^2 - y^2\right)\, dy} $$

$$ V = 4\left. \left(r^2y - \frac{1}{3}y^3\right) \right|_{-r}^{r} $$

$$ V = 4\left[\left(r^2(r) - \frac{1}{3}(r)^3\right) - \left(r^2(-r) - \frac{1}{3}(-r)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\left[r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3 - \left(-r^3 + \frac{1}{3}r^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\left[r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3 + r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = 4\left[2r^3 - \frac{2}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = 4\left[\frac{6}{3}r^3 - \frac{2}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = 4\left[\frac{4}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{16}{3}r^3} $$

**3.** Find the volume of the solid whose base is the region bounded by
$x = 2 - y^2$ and $x = y^2 - 2$ and whose cross-sections are Isosceles triangles
with the base perpendicular to the $y$-axis and the angle between the base and
the two sides of equal length is $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$. See figure below to see a
sketch of the cross-sections.

**Solution**

Because the base is perpendicular to the $y$-axis, the Area must be expressed as
$A(y)$.

Let's keep things simple and find the Area of the Isosceles triangle, which is
our cross-section. A standard triangle area formula is:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}bh $$

Since this is an Isosceles Triangle and not an Equilateral triangle, we'll need
to establish in terms of both $b$ and $h$ first. After dividing the Isosceles
triangle in half, we get two rright angle trangles with an unknown hypotenuse, a
height $h$, and a base, $\dfrac{b}{2}$. To find the height, we'll have to use
right angle triangle trigonometry.

$$ \text{hypotenuse} = \frac{\text{height}}{\text{base}} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} $$

Taking this knowledge, we can translate what we know about this particular
triangle as:

$$ \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{h}{\dfrac{b}{2}} $$

$$ h = \frac{b}{2}\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) $$

This still isn't in terms of $y$, which we need, because we need $b$ in terms of
$y$.

Recall though that our base is bounded by the given region between $x = 2 - y^2$
and $x = y^2 - 2$

We can take the positive of this $x = 2 - y^2$ and set it equal to our base of
$\dfrac{b}{2}$ to find $b$ in terms of $y$:

$$ \frac{b}{2} = 2 - y^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 2\left(2 - y^2\right) $$

And now let's plug that in for height:

$$ h = \frac{b}{2}\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) $$

$$ h = \frac{2\left(2 - y^2\right)}{2}\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) $$

$$ h = \left(2 - y^2\right)\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) $$

$$ h = \left(2 - y^2\right)(1) $$

$$ h = 2 - y^2 $$

This now can give us $A$ as $A(y)$:

$$ A(y) = \frac{1}{2}\left[2\left(2 - y^2\right)\right]\left(2 - y^2\right) $$

$$ A(y) = \left(2 - y^2\right)\left(2 - y^2\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 4 - 4y^2 + y^4 $$

We are given our bounded regions which is our limits of integration, but they
are expressions of $f(y)$/$x$, we need them in terms of $y$. By setting either
region boundary equation to $x = 0$, we'll find our limits of integration.

$$ 0 = y^2 - 2 $$

$$ y^2 = 2$$

$$ y = \pm \sqrt{2} $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ -\sqrt{2} \leq y \leq \sqrt{2} $$

Let's solve by finding our volume:

$$ V = \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}{4 - 4y^2 + y^4\, dy} $$

$$ V = \left. \left(4y - \frac{4}{3}y^3 + \frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} $$

$$ V = \left[\left(4\left(\sqrt{2}\right) - \frac{4}{3}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{5}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^5\right) - \left(4\left(-\sqrt{2}\right) - \frac{4}{3}\left(-\sqrt{2}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{5}\left(-\sqrt{2}\right)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{64\sqrt{2}}{15}} $$

**4.** Find the volume of a wedge cut out of a "cylinder" whose base is the
region bounded by $y = \sqrt{4 - x}$, $x = -4$ and the $x$-axis. The angle
between the top and bottom of the wedge is $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$. See the figure
below for a sketch of the "cylinder" and the wedge (the positive $x$-axis and
the positive $y$-axis are shown in the sketch - they are just in a different
orientation).

![image 6.5_12](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/CalcI/MoreVolume_Files/image003.gif)

**Solution**

This is an interesting shape in that our base is defined both by a straight line
in $x = -4$ and a parabola in $y = \sqrt{4 - x}$ as well as the $x$-axis, or
$y = 0$.

Because the cross-section is perpendicular to the $x$-axis, as defined by one of
it's boundary functions, we know the area must be expressed as $A(x)$.

Our cross-section is most certainly a right triangle, so our basic area function
is:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}bh $$

Our base is the length from the $x$-axis, or $y = 0$, to the boundary function
$y = \sqrt{4 - x}$, so our base is:

$$ b = \sqrt{4 - x} - 0 = \sqrt{4 - x} $$

Now, we just need our height in terms of $x$ as well:

$$ h = b\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) $$

$$ h = \sqrt{3}b $$

$$ h = \sqrt{3}\left(\sqrt{4 - x}\right) $$

So our $A(x)$ is:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}bh $$

$$ A(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(4 - x)$$

Our limits of integration must be in terms of $x$, one of which is given to us
in terms of $x = -4$. The other is given to us as $y = \sqrt{4 - x}$, but if we
set this to $y = 0$, we'll find where our base's upper limit is.

$$ y = \sqrt{4 - x} $$

$$ 0 = \sqrt{4 - x} $$

$$ 0 = 4 - x $$

$$ x = 4 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ -4 \leq x \leq 4 $$

We can now find our Volume:

$$ V = \int_{-4}^{4}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(4 - x)\, dx} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\int_{-4}^{4}{4 - x\, dx}  $$

$$ V = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left. \left(4x - \frac{1}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{-4}^{4} $$

$$ V = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left[\left(4(4) - \frac{1}{2}(4)^2\right) - \left(4(-4) - \frac{1}{2}(-4)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left[16 - 8 - \left(-16 - 8\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left[16 - 8 + 16 + 8\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{32\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

$$ \boxed{V = 16\sqrt{3}} $$

## Assignment Problems

**1.** Use the method of finding volume from this section to determine the
volume of a sphere of radius $r$.

**Solution**

If we orient the sphere around a standard Cartesian graph, our cross-section
will be oriented perpendicular to the $x$-axis and therefore our Area will be
expressed in terms of $A(x)$.

Each cross-section will be a simple circle, and we know the standard area
function of a circle is:

$$ A = \pi r^2 $$

Since we need our Area in terms of $A(x)$, we'll need our radius expressed in
terms of $x$. Let's express the basic radius formula:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 $$

We'll need this in terms of $f(x)$/$y$ to fit into our $A(x)$ formula.

$$ y^2 = r^2 - x^2 $$

$$ y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} $$

We omit the $\pm$ because we're dealing with a 3-dimensional shape which can't
have a negative dimension in this case.

So our $A(x)$ is:

$$ A = \pi r^2 $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right)^2 $$

$$ A(x) = \pi\left(r^2 - x^2\right) $$

Our limits of integration simply go along the $x$-axis from $-r$ to $r$, so our
limits of integration are:

$$ -r \leq x \leq r $$

We can set up our volume formula now:

$$ V = \int_{-r}^{r}{\pi\left(r^2 - x^2\right)\, dx} = \pi\int_{-r}^{r}{r^2 - x^2\, dx} $$

$$ V = \pi\left. \left(r^2x - \frac{1}{3}x^3\right) \right|{-r}_{r} $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\left(r^2(r) - \frac{1}{3}(r)^3\right) - \left(r^2(-r) - \frac{1}{3}(-r)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3 - \left(-r^3 + \frac{1}{3}r^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3 + r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[2r^3 - \frac{2}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = \pi\left[\frac{6}{3}r^3 - \frac{2}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3} $$

**2.** Find the volume of the solid whose base is the region bounded by
$x = 2 - y^2$ and $x = y^2 - 2$ and whose cross-sections are squares with the
base perpendicular to the $y$-axis. See figure below to see a sketch of the
cross-sections.

![image 6.5_13](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ProblemsNS/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image001.gif)

**Solution**

Since our base is perpendicular to the $y$-axis, our Area must be in terms of
$A(y)$.

Since our cross-sections are squares, we know the basic Area formula will be:

$$ A = s^2 $$

Where $s$ represents the length of one side of the square.

We'll need $s$ in terms of $y$ as we need to find $A(y)$.

We know that $\dfrac{s}{2}$ is equal to either $x = y^2 - 2$ or $x = 2 - y^2$,
we'll set it to the latter to get a positive output.

$$ \frac{s}{2} = 2 - y^2 $$

$$ s = 2\left(2 - y^2\right) $$

$$ s = 4 - 2y^2 $$

So $A(y)$ is:

$$ A = s^2 $$

$$ A(y) = \left(4 - 2y^2\right)^2 $$

$$ A(y) = \left(4 - 2y^2\right)\left(4 - 2y^2\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 16 - 16y^2 + 4y^4 $$

$$ A(y) = 4\left(4 - 4y^2 + y^4\right) $$

Our limits of integration must be in terms of $y$, by setting either given
boundary of $x = y^2 - 2$ or $x = 2 - y^2$ to $0$, we can find our limits.

$$ 2 - y^2 = 0 $$

$$ 2 = y^2 $$

$$ \pm \sqrt{2} = y $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ -\sqrt{2} \leq y \leq \sqrt{2} $$

And our volume is:

$$ V = 4\int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}{4 - 4y^2 + y^4\, dy} $$

$$ V = 4\left. \left(4y - \frac{4}{3}y^3 + \frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} $$

$$ V = 4\left[\left(4\left(\sqrt{2}\right) - \frac{4}{3}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{5}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^5\right) - \left(4\left(-\sqrt{2}\right) - \frac{4}{3}\left(-\sqrt{2}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{5}\left(-\sqrt{2}\right)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\left(\frac{64\sqrt{2}}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{256\sqrt{2}}{15}} $$

**3.** Find the volume of the solid whose base is a disk of radius $r$ and whose
cross-sections are rectangles whose height is half the length of the base and
whose base is perpendicular to the $x$-axis. See figure below to see a sketch of
the cross-sections (the positive $x$-axis and positive $y$-axis are shown in the
sketch).

![image 6.5_14](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ProblemsNS/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image002.gif)

**Solution**

Since the base is perpendicular to the $x$-axis, our Area must be in terms of
$A(x)$. We know that the area of a rectangular in it's most basic form is
expressed as:

$$ A = bh $$

Since we know this is a rectangle, we know that $b$ and $h$ are not necessarily
equivalent. In fact, the problem statement makes this explicit where we know
that:

$$ h = \frac{1}{2}b $$

To find $A(x)$, we'll need both $h$ and $b$ in terms of $x$. We can do this
using the knowledge that the base of our shape is a disk/circle and relate both
the base and height of the rectangle to the disk.

We know that the base of the rectangle is equal to 2 times the radius of the
disk.

$$ b = 2r $$

We know that the basic formula for a circle is:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 $$

So let's express that in terms of $x$:

$$ y^2 = r^2 - x^2 $$

$$ y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} $$

And again, we omit the $\pm$ as we are dealing with a 3-dimensional shape.

Now we can express $b$ in terms of $x$:

$$ b = 2r $$

$$ b = 2\sqrt{r^2 - x^2} $$

And the height in terms of $x$:

$$ h = \frac{1}{2}b $$

$$ h = \frac{1}{2}\left(2\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right) $$

$$ h = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} $$

Finally we can find $A(x)$:

$$ A = bh $$

$$ A(x) = 2\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\left(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\left(r^2 - x^2\right) $$

We know that our limits of integration are simply $-r$ to $r$:

$$ -r \leq x \leq r $$

So our volume is:

$$ V = 2\int_{-r}^{r}{r^2 - x^2\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\left. \left(r^2x - \frac{1}{3}x^3\right) \right|_{-r}^{r} $$

$$ V = 2\left[\left(r^2(r) - \frac{1}{3}(r)^3\right) - \left(r^2(-r) - \frac{1}{3}(-r)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\left[r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3 - \left(-r^3 + \frac{1}{3}r^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\left[r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3 + r^3 - \frac{1}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = 2\left[2r^3 - \frac{2}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = 2\left[\frac{6}{3}r^3 - \frac{2}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ V = 2\left[\frac{4}{3}r^3\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{8}{3}r^3} $$

**4.** Find the volume of the solid whose base is the region bounded by
$y = x^2 - 1$ and $y = 3$ and whose cross-sections are equilateral triangles
with the base perpendicular to the $y$-axis. See figure below to see a sketch 9f
the cross-sections.

![image 6.5_15](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ProblemsNS/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image003.gif)

**Solution**

Since the base of our solid is perpendicular to the $y$-axis, our Area must be
an expression of $A(y)$.

To find a basic expression of $A$, we'll first establish each side of the
equilateral triangle's as represented as $s$.

We know we can look up the basic Area formula of an equilateral triangle, but
let's think this through first. By dividing the equilateral triangle into two
right angle triangle's we know that the area of a basic right angle triangle is:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}bh $$

From the lecture notes, we've seen the basic expression of height as:

$$ \frac{h}{b} = \tan\theta $$

We know $\theta = \dfrac{\pi}{3}$ for an equilateral triangle:

$$ \frac{h}{b} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) $$

$$ h = b\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) $$

$$ h = \sqrt{3}b $$

And we know that $b = \dfrac{s}{2}$ as we divided $s$ by 2 to get $b$. This
means we can evaluate our Area for our Equilateral triangle in terms of $s$ like
so:

$$ A = bh $$

$$ A = \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\left(\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\right) $$

$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 $$

Now we need to express $A$ in terms of $A(y)$. We can do this by somehow
relating $s$ to $y$. We know that the base of the cross-section triangle is
bounded by $y = x^2 - 1$, but again, we need this in terms of $y$, so let's
convert it:

$$ y = x^2 - 1 $$

$$ y + 1 = x^2 $$

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{y + 1} $$

The right boundary is the positive and the left boundary of the negative, and
the value of $s$ is simply the difference between these two:

$$ s = \sqrt{y + 1} - \left(-\sqrt{y + 1}\right) $$

$$ s = \sqrt{y + 1} + \sqrt{y + 1} $$

$$ s = 2\sqrt{y + 1} $$

So now we can express $A(y)$:

$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\left(2\sqrt{y + 1}\right)^2 $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\left(4(y + 1)\right) $$

$$ A(y) = \sqrt{3}(y + 1) $$

Our limits of integration must be in terms of $y$. One of our bounding regions
is given to us simply as $y = 3$, and if we set $x = 0$ for $y = x^2 - 1$, we'll
find our other bounding region.

$$ y = x^2 - 1 $$

$$ y = (0)^2 - 1 $$

$$ y = -1 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ -1 \leq y \leq 3 $$

So our volume is:

$$ V = \sqrt{3}\int_{-1}^{3}{y + 1\, dy} $$

$$ V = \sqrt{3}\left. \left(\frac{1}{2}y^2 + y\right) \right|_{-1}^{3} $$

$$ V = \sqrt{3}\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}(3)^2 + (3)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}(-1)^2 + (-1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \sqrt{3}\left[\frac{9}{2} + 3 - \left(\frac{1}{2} - 1\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \sqrt{3}\left[\frac{9}{2} + 3 - \frac{1}{2} + 1\right] $$

$$ V = \sqrt{3}\left[\frac{8}{2} + 4\right] $$

$$ V = \sqrt{3}\left[4 + 4\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 8\sqrt{3}} $$

**5.** Find the volume of the solid whose base is the region bounded by
$x = 2 - y^2$ and $x = y^2 - 2$ and whose cross-sections are the upper half of
the circle centered on the $y$-axis. See figure below to see a sketch of the
cross-sections.

![image 6.5_16](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ProblemsNS/CalcI/MoreVolumeProblems_Files/image004.gif)

**Solution**

Centered on the $y$-axis tells us that our volume is perpendicular to the
$y$-axis, so our Area must be in terms of $A(y)$.

We know that the area of a semi-circle is simply:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}\pi r^2 $$

We now have to relate this to $y$ to express this as $A(y)$. We are given two
bboundary functions, the right being $x = 2 - y^2$ and the left being
$x = y^2 - 2$. We know that the diameter is simply the left subtracted from the
right:

$$ d = \left(2 - y^2\right) - \left(y^2 - 2\right) $$

$$ d = 2 - y^2 - y^2 + 2 $$

$$ d = 4 - 2y^2 $$

And the radius is simply half that:

$$ r = \frac{1}{2}\left(4 - 2y^2\right) $$

$$ r = 2 - y^2 $$

This leaves us with our Area in terms of $A(y)$:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2}\pi r^2 $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{1}{2}\pi\left(2 - y^2\right)^2 $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{1}{2}\pi\left(2 - y^2\right)\left(2 - y^2\right) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{1}{2}\pi\left(4 - 4y^2 + y^4\right) $$

Our limits of integration must be in terms of $y$, we can find our limits by
setting $x = 0$ on both our boundaries to find that.

$$ x = y^2 - 2 $$

$$ 0 = y^2 - 2 $$

$$ y^2 = 2 $$

$$ y = \pm \sqrt{2} $$

$$ x = 2 - y^2 $$

$$ 0 = 2 - y^2 $$

$$ -y^2 = -2 $$

$$ y^2 = 2 $$

$$ y = \pm \sqrt{2} $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ -\sqrt{2} \leq y \leq \sqrt{2} $$

And our volume is:

$$ V = \frac{1}{2}\pi\int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}{4 - 4y^2 + y^4\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{2}\pi\left. \left(4y - \frac{4}{3}y^3 + \frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{2}\pi\left[\left(4\left(\sqrt{2}\right) - \frac{4}{3}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{5}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^5\right) - \left(4\left(-\sqrt{2}\right) - \frac{4}{3}\left(-\sqrt{2}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{5}\left(-\sqrt{2}\right)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{1}{2}\pi\left(\frac{86\sqrt{2}}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{43\sqrt{2}}{15}\pi} $$
