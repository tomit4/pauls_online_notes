# Section 6.4 : Volume With Cylinders

In the previous section we started looking at finding volumes of solids of
revolution. In that section we took cross sections that were rings or disks,
found the cross-sectional area and then used the following formulas to find the
volume of the solid.

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx}  \quad V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

In the previous section we only used cross sections that were in the shape of a
disk or a ring. This however does not always need to be the case. We can use any
shape for the cross sections as long as it can be expanded or contracted to
completely cover the solid we’re looking at. This is a good thing because as our
first example will show us we can't always use rings/disks.

---

**Example 1** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = (x - 1)(x - 3)^2$ and the $x$-axis about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

As we did in the previous section, let's first graph the bounded region and
solid. Note that the bounded region here is the shaded portion shown. The curve
is extended out a little past this for the purposes of illustrating what the
curve looks like.

![image 6.4_2](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image002.gif)

So, we've basically got something that’s roughly doughnut shaped. If we were to
use rings on this solid here is what a typical ring would look like.

This leads to several problems. First, both the inner and outer radius are
defined by the same function. This, in itself, can be dealt with on occasion as
we saw in a example in the
[**Area Between Curves**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/AreaBetweenCurves.aspx#IntApps_Area_Ex6)
section. However, this usually means more work than other methods so it's often
not the best approach.

This leads to the second problem we got here. In order to use rings we would
need to put this function into the form $x = f(y)$. That is NOT easy in general
for a cubic polynomial and in other cases may not even be possible to do. Even
when it is possible to do this the resulting equation is often significantly
messier than the original which can also cause problems.

The last problem with rings in this case is not so much a problem as it's just
added work. If we were to use rings the limit would be $y$ limits and this means
that we will need to know how high the graph goes. To this point the limits of
integration have always been intersection points that were fairly easy to find.
However, in this case the highest point is not an intersection point, but
instead a relative maximum. We spent several sections in the Applications of
Derivatives chapter talking about how to find maximum values of functions.
However, finding them can, on occasion, take some work.

So, we've seen three problems with rings in this case that will either increase
our work load or outright prevent us from using rings.

What we need to do is to find a different way to cut the solid that will give us
a cross-sectional area that we can work with. One way to do this is to think of
our solid as a lump of cookie dough and instead of cutting it perpendicular to
the axis of rotation we could instead center a cylindrical cookie cutter on the
axis of rotation and push this down into the solid. Doing this would give the
following picture,

![image 6.4_3](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image003.gif)

![image 6.4_4](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image004.gif)

Doing this gives us a cylinder or shell in the object and we can easily find its
surface area. The surface area of this cylinder is,

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(x)\left((x - 1)(x - 3)^2\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(x^4 - 7x^3 + 15x^2 - 9x\right) $$

Notice as well that as we increase the radius of the cylinder we will completely
cover the solid and so we can use this in our formula to find the volume of this
solid. All we need are limits of integration. The first cylinder will cut into
the solid at $x = 1$ and as we increase $x$ to $x = 3$

we will completely cover both sides of the solid since expanding the cylinder in
one direction will automatically expand it in the other direction as well.

The volume of this solid is then,

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{3}{x^4 - 7x^3 + 15x^2 - 9x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{7}{4}x^4 + 5x^3 - \frac{9}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{1}^{3} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{24\pi}{5} $$

---

The method used in the last example is called the **method of cylinders** or
**method of shells**. The formula for the area in all cases will be,

> $$ A = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

There are a couple of important differences between this method and the method
of rings/disks that we should note before moving on. First, rotation about a
vertical axis will give an area that is a function of $x$ and rotation about a
horizontal axis will give an area that is a function of $y$.

This is exactly opposite of the method of rings/disks.

Second, we don’t take the complete range of x or y for the limits of integration
as we did in the previous section. Instead we take a range of $x$ or $y$ that
will cover one side of the solid. As we noted in the first example if we expand
out the radius to cover one side we will automatically expand in the other
direction as well to cover the other side.

Let's take a look at another example.

---

**Example 2** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = \sqrt[3]{x}$ $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

First let's get a graph of the bounded region and the solid.

![image 6.4_5](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image007.gif)

![image 6.4_6](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image008.gif)

Okay, we are rotating about a horizontal axis. This means that the area will be
a function of $y$ and so our equation will also need to be written in $x = f(y)$
form.

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y^3 $$

As we did in the ring/disk section let's take a couple of looks at a typical
cylinder. The sketch on the left shows a typical cylinder with the back half of
the object also in the sketch to give the right sketch some context. The sketch
on the right contains a typical cylinder and only the curves that define the
edge of the solid.

![image 6.4_7](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image009.gif)

![image 6.4_8](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image010.gif)

In this case the width of the cylinder is not the function value as it was in
the previous example. In this case the function value is the distance between
the edge of the cylinder and the $y$-axis. The distance from the edge out to the
line is $x = 8$ and so the width is then $8 - y^3$. The cross-sectional area in
this case is,

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{width}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(y)\left(8 - y^3\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(8y - y^4\right) $$

The first cylinder will cut into the solid at $y = 0$ and the final cylinder
will cut in at $y = 2$ and so these are our limits of integration.

The volume of this solid is,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \int_{0}^{2}{8y - y^4\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(4y^2 - \frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{96\pi}{5} $$

---

The remaining examples in this section will have axis of rotation about axis
other than the $x$ and $y$-axis. As with the method of rings/disks we will need
to be a little careful with these.

---

**Example 3** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = 2\sqrt{x - 1}$ and $y = x - 1$ about the line $x = 6$.

**Solution**

Here's a graph of the bounded region and solid.

![image 6.4_9](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image011.gif)

![image 6.4_10](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image012.gif)

Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder. Again, the sketch on the left is
here to provide some context for the sketch on the right.

![image 6.4_11](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image013.gif)

![image 6.4_12](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image014.gif)

Okay, there is a lot going on in the sketch to the left. First notice that the
radius is not just an $x$ or $y$ as it was in the previous two cases. In this
case $x$ is the distance from the $y$-axis to the edge of the cylinder and we
need the distance from the axis of rotation to the edge of the cylinder. That
means that the radius of this cylinder is $6 - x$.

Secondly, the height of the cylinder is the difference of the two functions in
this case.

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(6 - x)\left(2\sqrt{x - 1} - x + 1\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(x^2 - 7x + 6 + 12\sqrt{x - 1} - 2x\sqrt{x - 1}\right) $$

Now the first cylinder will cut into the solid at $x = 1$ and the first cylinder
will cut into the solid at $x = 5$ so there are our limits.

Here is the volume.

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{5}{x^2 - 7x + 6 + 12\sqrt{x - 1} - 2x\sqrt{x - 1}\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{7}{2}x^2 + 6x + 8(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{4}{3}(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{4}{5}(x - 1)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(\frac{136}{15}\right) $$

$$ \quad = \frac{272\pi}{15} $$

The integration of the last term is a little tricky so let's do that here. It
will use the substitution,

$$ u = x - 1 \quad du = dx \quad x = u + 1 $$

$$ \int{2x\sqrt{x - 1}\, dx} = 2\int{(u + 1)u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ \quad = 2\int{u^{\frac{3}{2}} + u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ \quad = 2\left(\frac{2}{5}u^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{2}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) + c $$

$$ \quad = \frac{4}{5}(x - 1)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{4}{3}(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} + c $$

We saw one of these kinds of substitutions back in the
[**substitution**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/SubstitutionRuleIndefinitePtII.aspx#Int_SubInd_II_Ex4)
section.

**Example 4** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $x = (y - 2)^2$ and $y = x$ about the line $y = -1$.

**Solution**

We should first get the intersection points there.

$$ y = (y - 2)^2 $$

$$ y = y^2 - 4y + 4 $$

$$ 0 = y^2 - 5y + 4 $$

$$ 0 = (y - 4)(y - 1) $$

So, the two curves will intersect at $y = 1$ and $y = 4$. Here is a sketch of
the bounded region and the solid.

![image 6.4_13](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image015.gif)

![image 6.4_14](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image016.gif)

Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder. The sketch on the left is here to
provide some context for the sketch on the right.

![image 6.4_15](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image017.gif)

![image 6.4_16](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image018.gif)

Here's the cross-sectional area for this cylinder.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{width}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(y + 1)\left(y - (y - 2)^2\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(-y^3 + 4y^2 + y - 4\right) $$

The first cylinder will cut into the solid at $y = 1$ and the final cylinder
will cut in at $y = 4$. The volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{4}{-y^3 + 4y^2 + y - 4\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(-\frac{1}{4}y^4 + \frac{4}{3}y^3 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 - 4y\right) \right|_{1}^{4} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{63\pi}{2} $$
