# Section 6.4 : Volume With Cylinders

In the previous section we started looking at finding volumes of solids of
revolution. In that section we took cross sections that were rings or disks,
found the cross-sectional area and then used the following formulas to find the
volume of the solid.

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx}  \quad V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

In the previous section we only used cross sections that were in the shape of a
disk or a ring. This however does not always need to be the case. We can use any
shape for the cross sections as long as it can be expanded or contracted to
completely cover the solid we’re looking at. This is a good thing because as our
first example will show us we can't always use rings/disks.

---

**Example 1** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = (x - 1)(x - 3)^2$ and the $x$-axis about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

As we did in the previous section, let's first graph the bounded region and
solid. Note that the bounded region here is the shaded portion shown. The curve
is extended out a little past this for the purposes of illustrating what the
curve looks like.

![image 6.4_2](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image002.gif)

So, we've basically got something that’s roughly doughnut shaped. If we were to
use rings on this solid here is what a typical ring would look like.

This leads to several problems. First, both the inner and outer radius are
defined by the same function. This, in itself, can be dealt with on occasion as
we saw in a example in the
[**Area Between Curves**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/AreaBetweenCurves.aspx#IntApps_Area_Ex6)
section. However, this usually means more work than other methods so it's often
not the best approach.

This leads to the second problem we got here. In order to use rings we would
need to put this function into the form $x = f(y)$. That is NOT easy in general
for a cubic polynomial and in other cases may not even be possible to do. Even
when it is possible to do this the resulting equation is often significantly
messier than the original which can also cause problems.

The last problem with rings in this case is not so much a problem as it's just
added work. If we were to use rings the limit would be $y$ limits and this means
that we will need to know how high the graph goes. To this point the limits of
integration have always been intersection points that were fairly easy to find.
However, in this case the highest point is not an intersection point, but
instead a relative maximum. We spent several sections in the Applications of
Derivatives chapter talking about how to find maximum values of functions.
However, finding them can, on occasion, take some work.

So, we've seen three problems with rings in this case that will either increase
our work load or outright prevent us from using rings.

What we need to do is to find a different way to cut the solid that will give us
a cross-sectional area that we can work with. One way to do this is to think of
our solid as a lump of cookie dough and instead of cutting it perpendicular to
the axis of rotation we could instead center a cylindrical cookie cutter on the
axis of rotation and push this down into the solid. Doing this would give the
following picture,

![image 6.4_3](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image003.gif)

![image 6.4_4](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image004.gif)

Doing this gives us a cylinder or shell in the object and we can easily find its
surface area. The surface area of this cylinder is,

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(x)\left((x - 1)(x - 3)^2\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(x^4 - 7x^3 + 15x^2 - 9x\right) $$

Notice as well that as we increase the radius of the cylinder we will completely
cover the solid and so we can use this in our formula to find the volume of this
solid. All we need are limits of integration. The first cylinder will cut into
the solid at $x = 1$ and as we increase $x$ to $x = 3$

we will completely cover both sides of the solid since expanding the cylinder in
one direction will automatically expand it in the other direction as well.

The volume of this solid is then,

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{3}{x^4 - 7x^3 + 15x^2 - 9x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{7}{4}x^4 + 5x^3 - \frac{9}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{1}^{3} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{24\pi}{5} $$

---

The method used in the last example is called the **method of cylinders** or
**method of shells**. The formula for the area in all cases will be,

> $$ A = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

There are a couple of important differences between this method and the method
of rings/disks that we should note before moving on. First, rotation about a
vertical axis will give an area that is a function of $x$ and rotation about a
horizontal axis will give an area that is a function of $y$.

This is exactly opposite of the method of rings/disks.

Second, we don’t take the complete range of x or y for the limits of integration
as we did in the previous section. Instead we take a range of $x$ or $y$ that
will cover one side of the solid. As we noted in the first example if we expand
out the radius to cover one side we will automatically expand in the other
direction as well to cover the other side.

Let's take a look at another example.

---

**Example 2** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = \sqrt[3]{x}$ $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

First let's get a graph of the bounded region and the solid.

![image 6.4_5](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image007.gif)

![image 6.4_6](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image008.gif)

Okay, we are rotating about a horizontal axis. This means that the area will be
a function of $y$ and so our equation will also need to be written in $x = f(y)$
form.

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y^3 $$

As we did in the ring/disk section let's take a couple of looks at a typical
cylinder. The sketch on the left shows a typical cylinder with the back half of
the object also in the sketch to give the right sketch some context. The sketch
on the right contains a typical cylinder and only the curves that define the
edge of the solid.

![image 6.4_7](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image009.gif)

![image 6.4_8](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image010.gif)

In this case the width of the cylinder is not the function value as it was in
the previous example. In this case the function value is the distance between
the edge of the cylinder and the $y$-axis. The distance from the edge out to the
line is $x = 8$ and so the width is then $8 - y^3$. The cross-sectional area in
this case is,

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{width}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(y)\left(8 - y^3\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(8y - y^4\right) $$

The first cylinder will cut into the solid at $y = 0$ and the final cylinder
will cut in at $y = 2$ and so these are our limits of integration.

The volume of this solid is,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \int_{0}^{2}{8y - y^4\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(4y^2 - \frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{96\pi}{5} $$

---

The remaining examples in this section will have axis of rotation about axis
other than the $x$ and $y$-axis. As with the method of rings/disks we will need
to be a little careful with these.

---

**Example 3** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = 2\sqrt{x - 1}$ and $y = x - 1$ about the line $x = 6$.

**Solution**

Here's a graph of the bounded region and solid.

![image 6.4_9](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image011.gif)

![image 6.4_10](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image012.gif)

Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder. Again, the sketch on the left is
here to provide some context for the sketch on the right.

![image 6.4_11](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image013.gif)

![image 6.4_12](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image014.gif)

Okay, there is a lot going on in the sketch to the left. First notice that the
radius is not just an $x$ or $y$ as it was in the previous two cases. In this
case $x$ is the distance from the $y$-axis to the edge of the cylinder and we
need the distance from the axis of rotation to the edge of the cylinder. That
means that the radius of this cylinder is $6 - x$.

Secondly, the height of the cylinder is the difference of the two functions in
this case.

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(6 - x)\left(2\sqrt{x - 1} - x + 1\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(x^2 - 7x + 6 + 12\sqrt{x - 1} - 2x\sqrt{x - 1}\right) $$

Now the first cylinder will cut into the solid at $x = 1$ and the first cylinder
will cut into the solid at $x = 5$ so there are our limits.

Here is the volume.

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{5}{x^2 - 7x + 6 + 12\sqrt{x - 1} - 2x\sqrt{x - 1}\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{7}{2}x^2 + 6x + 8(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{4}{3}(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{4}{5}(x - 1)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(\frac{136}{15}\right) $$

$$ \quad = \frac{272\pi}{15} $$

The integration of the last term is a little tricky so let's do that here. It
will use the substitution,

$$ u = x - 1 \quad du = dx \quad x = u + 1 $$

$$ \int{2x\sqrt{x - 1}\, dx} = 2\int{(u + 1)u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ \quad = 2\int{u^{\frac{3}{2}} + u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ \quad = 2\left(\frac{2}{5}u^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{2}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) + c $$

$$ \quad = \frac{4}{5}(x - 1)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{4}{3}(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} + c $$

We saw one of these kinds of substitutions back in the
[**substitution**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/SubstitutionRuleIndefinitePtII.aspx#Int_SubInd_II_Ex4)
section.

**Example 4** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $x = (y - 2)^2$ and $y = x$ about the line $y = -1$.

**Solution**

We should first get the intersection points there.

$$ y = (y - 2)^2 $$

$$ y = y^2 - 4y + 4 $$

$$ 0 = y^2 - 5y + 4 $$

$$ 0 = (y - 4)(y - 1) $$

So, the two curves will intersect at $y = 1$ and $y = 4$. Here is a sketch of
the bounded region and the solid.

![image 6.4_13](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image015.gif)

![image 6.4_14](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image016.gif)

Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder. The sketch on the left is here to
provide some context for the sketch on the right.

![image 6.4_15](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image017.gif)

![image 6.4_16](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image018.gif)

Here's the cross-sectional area for this cylinder.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{width}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(y + 1)\left(y - (y - 2)^2\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(-y^3 + 4y^2 + y - 4\right) $$

The first cylinder will cut into the solid at $y = 1$ and the final cylinder
will cut in at $y = 4$. The volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{4}{-y^3 + 4y^2 + y - 4\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(-\frac{1}{4}y^4 + \frac{4}{3}y^3 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 - 4y\right) \right|_{1}^{4} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{63\pi}{2} $$

## Practice Problems

For each of the following problems use the method of cylinders to determine the
volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the given curves
about the given axis.

**1.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = (y - 2)^2$, the $x$-axis and the
$y$-axis about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, unlike the method of rings, we must
have our functions in the form of $f(y)$, which they are in this case, no
adjustment is necessary of our given functions.

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our formula for the area of the
cylinder will be this:

$$ A = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

We'll also need our limits of integration.

Because we are simply rotating around a major axis, we can ascertain that our
radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width of the cylinder in this case is the distance from the $y$-axis to the
last point of intersection of the cylinder to the given function. In other
words, it simply is the function:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)(y - 2)^2 $$

Let's simply distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(y^2 - 4y + 4\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(y^3 - 4y^2 + 4y\right) $$

To find the limits of integration, find where the first ring of the cylinder
intersects with the function and the last ring of the cylinder that intersects
with the function. From the graph we can see that this occurs at $y =0$ and
$y = 2$ respectively. So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

We can now setup our Volume Formula:

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{f(y)\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{y^3 - 4y^2 + 4y\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{4}y^4 - \frac{4}{3}y^3 + 2y^2\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - \frac{4}{3}(2)^3 + 2(2)^2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - \frac{4}{3}(0)^3 + 2(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(4 - \frac{32}{3} + 8\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{8}{3}\pi} $$

**2.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = \dfrac{1}{x}$, $x = \dfrac{1}{2}$,
$x = 4$ and the $x$-axis about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $y$-axis, so functions must be in terms of $f(x)$,
which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around the $y$-axis, our Area function for our cylinder
will be in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The radius, since we are simply rotating around a major axis is $x$.

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is simply the given function:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\frac{x}{x}\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi $$

Now find the limits of integration. In this case they are given to us as the
first cylinder intersects our function at $x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and the second
cylinder intersects our function at $x = 4$:

$$ \frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 4 $$

Now find the Volume:

$$ V = \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{4}{2\pi\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. (x) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{4} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[(4) - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)  $$

$$ V = \pi\left(\frac{14}{2}\right)  $$

$$ \boxed{V = 7\pi} $$

**3.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 4x$ and $y = x^3$ about the $y$-axis.
For this problem assume that $x \geq 0$.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $y$-axis, so the given functions must be in terms of
$f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust them.

Since we are rotating around the $y$-axis, the Area of Cylinder Function must be
in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The radius is simply $x$, the height requires some thinking to find. The height
of base of our cylinder is defined by $x^3$ from the $x$-axis while the top of
our cylinder is defined by $4x$, thusly our height is the difference between
these two.

Note we omit the $\pm$ because the problem statement tells us that $x \geq 0$.
This leaves us with our area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(4x - x^3\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(4x^2 - x^4\right) $$

Our limits of integration are also bounded by where the first cylinder
intersects, note that our above two functions meet at $x = 0$. So our limits of
integration are:

$$ 4x = x^3 $$

$$ 4 = x^2 $$

$$ 2 = x $$

We omit the $\pm$ as the problem statement tells us that $x \geq 0$.

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

Now we find the volume.

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{4x^2 - x^4\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{4}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{5}x^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{4}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{5}(2)^5\right) - \left(\frac{4}{3}(0)^3 - \frac{1}{5}(0)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{32}{3} - \frac{32}{5}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{64}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{128}{15}\pi} $$

**4.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 4x$ and $y = x^3$ about the $x$-axis.
For this problem assume that $x \geq 0$.

**Solution**

We are now rotating about the $x$-axis for the same set of functions given to us
in problem 3. This means however that we'll have to adjust our given functions
so that they are in terms of $f(y)$.

$$ y = 4x $$

$$ x = \frac{1}{4}y $$

$$ y = x^3 $$

$$ x = \sqrt[3]{y} = y^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

Our area function is therefore an expression of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

And our width is the difference between our two functions, but the order is
reversed because $x = y^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is the second most outermost ring of the
cylinder.

$$ \text{width} = y^{\frac{1}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y $$

Our area is therefore:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(y^{\frac{1}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(y^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y^2\right) $$

Our limits of integration again can be found by finding the intersection points
of our two graphs, one of which is obviously $0$ by looking at the graph. The
other is determined by where they intersect.

$$ 4x = x^3 $$

$$ 4 = x^2 $$

$$ 2 = x $$

But this time we need the $y$-coordinate, let's plug it into either given
function and we'll find it:

$$ 4(2) = 8 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Thusly we can find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{8}{y^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y^2\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{3}{7}y^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}y^3\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}(8)^3\right) - \left(\frac{3}{7}(0)^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}(0)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}(8)^3\right)\right] $$

(3/7)(8)^(7/3) - (1/12)(8)^3

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{256}{21}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512}{21}\pi} $$

**5.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x + 1$, $y = 3$ and $x = 4$ about the
line $y = 10$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our functions must be in terms
of $f(y)$, they must be adjusted.

$$ y = 2x + 1 $$

$$ 2x = y - 1 $$

$$ x = \frac{1}{2}(y - 1) $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of width.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis that is above the major
$x$-axis, the radius must be adjusted from simply being $y$ to the value of the
minor $x$-axis minus $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width must also be adjusted, but has nothing to do with the axis of
rotation.

In this case we take the outermost ring of the cylinder, $x = 4$ and subtract it
from our given function in terms of $f(y)$ that we converted earlier:

$$ \text{width} = 4 - \left[\frac{1}{2}(y - 1)\right] $$

$$ \text{width} = \frac{8}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y + \frac{1}{2} $$

$$ \text{width} = \frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y $$

Our area function therefore becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(\frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y\right) $$

Now distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(\frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\frac{1}{2}y^2 - \frac{19}{2}y + 45\right) $$

Our limits of integration are given to us, but one of them needs to be
converted. The first cylinder base ring is simply $y = 3$, the other limit is
given as $x = 4$, which we'll have to plug into our given function to find the
outermost $y$ value:

$$ y = 2(4) + 1 = 9 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 3 \leq y \leq 9 $$

We can now find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{3}^{9}{\frac{1}{2}y^2 - \frac{19}{2}y + 45\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{6}y^3 - \frac{19}{4}y^2 + 45y\right) \right|_{3}^{9} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{6}(9)^3 - \frac{19}{4}(9)^2 + 45(9)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{6}(3)^3 - \frac{19}{4}(3)^2 + 45(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(45) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 90\pi} $$

**6.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 4$ and $x = 6 - 3y$ about the
line $y = -8$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, we must have our functions in
terms of $f(y)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our area function must be in
terms of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

If the axis of rotation was simply the $x$-axis, then the radius would just be
$y$, but in this case our axis of rotation is a negative minor $x$-axis. Thusly
we _add_ $y$ to the _absolute value_ of the axis value to get our radius:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(|-8| + y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(8 + y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Had our first bounding function simply been the $y$-axis, we could say that the
width was $x = 6 - 3y$, but we must actually subtract the first bounding
function by the second to get our width:

$$ \text{width } = 6 - 3y - \left(y^2 - 4\right) $$

$$ \text{width } = 6 - 3y - y^2 + 4 $$

$$ \text{width } = 10 - 3y - y^2 $$

This gives us the Area of:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(8 + y)\left(10 - 3y - y^2\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(8 + y)\left(10 - 3y - y^2\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(80 - y^3 - 11y^2 - 14y\right) $$

Our limits of integration can be ound by where our two given functions
intersect.

$$ y^2 - 4 = 6 - 3y $$

$$ y^2 + 3y - 10 = 0 $$

$$ (y + 5)(y - 2) = 0 $$

Our limits of integration therefore are:

$$ -5 \leq y \leq 2 $$

And now we find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-5}^{2}{80 - y^3 - 11y^2 - 14y\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(80y - \frac{1}{4}y^4 - \frac{11}{3}y^3 - 7y^2\right) \right|_{-5}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(80(2) - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - \frac{11}{3}(2)^3 - 7(2)^2\right) - \left(80(-5) - \frac{1}{4}(-5)^4 - \frac{11}{3}(-5)^3 - 7(-5)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{4459}{12}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{4459}{6}\pi} $$

**7.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = x^2 - 6x + 9$ and $y = -x^2 + 6x - 1$
about the line $x = 8$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, the given functions must be in
terms of $f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, the area must be expressed in
terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

If the axis of rotation was simply the $y$-axis, then the radius would simply be
$x$, but since that is not the case, we subtract $x$ from $x = 8$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(8 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

To find the height we subtract one function from the other. Looking at the
graph, we can see that within the boudning regions, the top or outer most
function is $y = -x^2 + 6x - 1$, and the lower function is $x^2 - 6x + 9$,
taking the difference will yield:

$$ \text{height} = -x^2 + 6x - 1 - \left(x^2 - 6x + 9\right) $$

$$ \text{height} = -x^2 + 6x - 1 - x^2 + 6x - 9 $$

$$ \text{height} = -2x^2 + 12x - 10 $$

This gives us our area formula:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(8 - x)\left(-2x^2 + 12x - 10\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(2x^3 - 28x^2 + 106x - 80\right) $$

To find the limits of integration, set the two given functions equal to one
another to find the points:

$$ x^2 - 6x + 9 = -x^2 + 6x - 1 $$

$$ 2x^2 - 12x + 10 = 0 $$

$$ 2\left(x^2 - 6x + 5\right) = 0 $$

$$ 2(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 $$

Thusly our limits of integration are:

$$ 1 \leq x \leq 5 $$

Our volume is therefore:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{1}^{5}{2x^3 - 28x^2 + 106x - 80\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - \frac{28}{3}x^3 + 53x^2 - 80x\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}(5)^4 - \frac{28}{3}(5)^3 + 53(5)^2 - 80(5)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}(1)^4 - \frac{28}{3}(1)^3 + 53(1)^2 - 80(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{320}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{640}{3}\pi} $$

**8.** Rotate the region bounded by
$y = \dfrac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}$, $y = 5 - \dfrac{1}{4}x$,
$x = -1$ and $x = 6$ about the line $x = -2$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our functions must be in terms
of $f(x)$, which they are, so there's no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our radius is expressed in terms of the absolute value of the negative
rotational axis value plus $x$:

$$ \text{radius} = |-2| + x $$

$$ \text{radius} = 2 + x $$

Our Area formula thus far therefore is:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 + x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is simply the top function minus the bottom function. From the graph
we can see that the top function is $y = 5 - \dfrac{1}{4}x$, and that the bottom
function is $y = \dfrac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}$.

$$ \text{height } = 5 - \frac{1}{4}x - \left(\frac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}\right) $$

Our area formula becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 + x)\left(5 - \frac{1}{4}x - \frac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}\right) $$

10 + 5x - (1/2)x - (1/4)(x^2)

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(10 + \frac{9}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}x^2 - \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x} \right) $$

In this case, the limits of our integration are given to us since both constant
boundaries are given in terms of $x$:

$$ -1 \leq x \leq 6 $$

The volume therefore is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-1}^{6}{10 + \frac{9}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}x^2 - \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(10x + \frac{9}{4}x^2 - \frac{1}{12}x^3 - 2\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}\right) \right|_{-1}^{6} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(10(6) + \frac{9}{4}(6)^2 - \frac{1}{12}(6)^3 - 2\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}(6)}\right) - \left(10(-1) + \frac{9}{4}(-1)^2 - \frac{1}{12}(-1)^3 - 2\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}(-1)}\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 2\pi\left[\frac{392}{3} - 2\mathbf{e}^3 + 2\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right]} $$

## Assignment Problems

For problems 1 - 14 use the method cylinders to determine the volume of the
solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the given curves about the
given axis.

**1.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $y = 8$ and the $y$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, the given functions must be
expressed in terms of $f(x)$, which they are, so no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, the Area function must be expressed
in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around a major $y$-axis, the radius is quite simply $x$.
Our area function therefore becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Looking at the graph, we can easily see that the "top" of our cylinder is capped
off by the given bounding function of $y = 8$, and that our "bottom" is capped
off by the given bounding funciton of $y = 2x^2$, thusly our height is simply
the difference of the "top" minus the "bottom". This causes our final Area
function to become:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(8 - 2x^2\right) $$

And simply distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(8x - 2x^3\right) $$

The limits of integration can be found in this case by looking at our graph and
seeing that the first "slice" of our cylinder occurs at $x = 0$. The last slice
occurs where the two given boundary functions intersect:

$$ 2x^2 = 8 $$

$$ x^2 = 4 $$

$$ x = \pm 2 $$

Because we are bounded by the major $y$-axis, we can omit the $\pm$ in this case
because only the region of $x \geq 0$ is relevant. This leaves our limits of
integration as:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

We can now find our Volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{8x - 2x^3\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(4x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^4\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(4(2)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(2)^4\right) - \left(4(0)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(0)^4\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(16 - 8\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(8) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 16\pi} $$

**2.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $y = 8$ and the $y$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

This is pretty much the same as problem 1, except we're now rotating around the
$x$-axis, which means that our given boundary functions must be given in terms
of $f(y)$. This means that one of our boundary functions need to be adjusted:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = x^2 $$

$$ x = \left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

Because we are rotating around the major $x$-axis, this means that our Area
funciton must be in terms of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

In similar thinking to problem 1, because we are rotating around a major
$x$-axis, the radius is simply $y$. This leaves our area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

In this case now, the width of the cylinder is simply the given boundary
function, adjusted of course for the new expression. This leaves our Area
function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

And simplify:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)y^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}y^{\frac{3}{2}} $$

Let's now find our limits of integration.

By looking at the graph, we can see that the inner "disk" of the cylinder occurs
at $y = 0$. The outer "disk" occurs simply at the given $y = 8$. Thusly our
limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Our volume formula is therefore:

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{0}^{8}{y^{\frac{3}{2}}\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}} \left. \left(\frac{2}{5}y^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{256\sqrt{2}}{5}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi(256)}{5} $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512\pi}{5}} $$

**3.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $x = 2$ and the $x$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

This is extremely similar to problem 2, but let's take it slow to be sure.

Because we are rotating around the $x$-axis, our given boundary functions must
be expressed in terms of $f(y)$. Let's adjust:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = x^2 $$

$$ x = \left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

Like problem 2, we are rotating around the $x$-axis, which means our Area
formula must be expressed in terms of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

By the same reasoning as problem 2, since we are rotating around the major
$x$-axis, our radius is simply $y$.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Similarly again to problem 2, our width is simply the second given boundary
function adjusted as done earlier. This leaves our area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

We can simplify this as before as:

$$ A(y) = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}y^{\frac{3}{2}} $$

The limits of integration actually are the same as problem 2 as well, but we
determine them in a different way. The first "disk" is the same as problem 2,
that of $y = 0$. For the second limit, because we are given a new additional
bounding region of $x = 2$, we can plug that into our other bounding function
and solve to find it:

$$ y = 2(2)^2 = 8 $$

Leaving our limits of integration as:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

And this leaves our Volume formula the same as problem 2, so no need to do
anything different here:

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{0}^{8}{y^{\frac{3}{2}}\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}} \left. \left(\frac{2}{5}y^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{256\sqrt{2}}{5}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi(256)}{5} $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512\pi}{5}} $$

**4.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $x = 2$ and the $x$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

And funny enough this is similar to problem 1, but let's go slow to be sure.

We are rotating about the $y$-axis, so thusly our functions must be expressed as
$f(x)$, which they are, so no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the major $y$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around a major $y$-axis, our radius is simply $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Ah, this is where we deviate from problem 1! If we look at our graph, we can see
that our "top" cap of the cylinder is $y = 2x^2$, and our "bottom" cap of the
cylinder is $y = 0$ (the $x$-axis). The height is the difference between these
two. This leaves the Area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(2x^2\right) $$

Simplifying the area gives us:

$$ A(x) = 4\pi x^3 $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

We can see that the bottom disk of our cylinder is simply at $x = 0$, and our
other limit is given to us in the boundary function of $x = 2$. This leaves our
limits of integration as:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

We can now find our Volume:

$$ V = 4\pi\int_{0}^{2}{x^3\, dx} $$

$$ V = 4\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 4\pi \left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(2)^4\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(0)^4\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi(4) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 16\pi} $$

**5.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around the $x$-axis, our functions must be presented in
terms of $f(y)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around the $x$-axis, our Area formula will be in terms
of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around the major $x$-axis, the radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width of the cylinder is $y^3$ up until it hits the other bounding function
$x = 8$, thusly our area function becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(8 - y^3\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(8y - y^4\right) $$

Let's find our limits of integration.

Looking at our graph, we can see that the first disk starts at $y = 0$, and we
can determine the last limit by setting our two given bounding functions equal
to one another.

$$ y^3 = 8 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

Let's now find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{8y - y^4\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(4y^2 - \frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(4(2)^2 - \frac{1}{5}(2)^5\right) - \left(4(0)^2 - \frac{1}{5}(0)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(16 - \frac{32}{5}\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{48}{5}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{96}{5}\pi} $$

**6.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

Similar to 5, but now we are rotating around the $y$-axis, which means our
functions must be in terms of $f(x)$. We need to adjust:

$$ x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{3}}  $$

Because we are rotating around the $y$-axis, this means that our area function
must be in terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around the major $y$-axis, our radius is simply $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The height in this case is the adjusted function we found earlier. This leaves
our area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(x^{\frac{1}{3}}\right) $$

Distributed:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi x^{\frac{4}{3}} $$

Let's now find our limits of integration.

In this case we can see from the graph that the beginning disk starts at
$x = 0$, and we are given the last disk by the bounding function $x = 8$, thusly
our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 8 $$

Now let's find our Volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{8}{x^{\frac{4}{3}}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{3}{7}x^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) - \left(\frac{3}{7}(0)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{384}{7}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{768}{7}\pi} $$

**7.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $y = 2$ and the $y$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our functions must be in terms of
$f(y)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our Area must be expressed in terms
of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $x$-axis, our radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

We are actually given our bounding region of $x = y^3$ which in this case
corresponds to our width. leaving our Area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(y^3\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi y^4 $$

Let's find the limits of integration. We can see from the graph that our first
disk is at $y = 0$, and we are given the second limit in $y = 2$, so our limits
of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

Now let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{y^4\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{5}(2)^5\right) - \left(\frac{1}{5}(0)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{32}{5}\right)$$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{64}{5}\pi} $$

**8.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $y = 2$ and the $y$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

Just like 7, but now we are rotating about the $y$-axis, meaning our functions
must be an expression of $f(x)$, and we need to adjust:

$$ x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, this means that our Area function
must be in terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $y$-axis, our radius is simply $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

And our height is simply the adjusted function we found earlier, leaving our
area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(x^{\frac{1}{3}}\right) $$

Distributed:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi x^{\frac{4}{3}} $$

Our limits of integration can be seen in the graph as starting at $x = 0$, and
ending where the first two given boundary functions meet, we can find this by
simply plugging in $y = 2$ into $x = y^3$:

$$ x = (2)^3 = 8 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 8 $$

Let's now find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{8}{x^{\frac{4}{3}}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{3}{7}x^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) - \left(\frac{3}{7}(0)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{768}{7}\pi} $$

**9.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = \dfrac{1}{x}$, $y = \dfrac{1}{3}$ and
$x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, our functions must be in terms of
$f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, our Area function must be in terms
of _height_.

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $y$-axis, our radius is simply $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Looking at our graph, we can see that our height is the difference between
$y = \dfrac{1}{x}$ and $y = \dfrac{1}{3}$, leaving our area formula as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{3}\right) $$

Distributed:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(1 - \frac{1}{3}x\right) $$

Let's now find the limits of integration.

Looking at the graph, we can see that we are given the beginning of the limits
of integration at $x = \dfrac{1}{2}$. The last disk of the cylinder exists where
$x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ meets $y = \dfrac{1}{x}$. We can find this by simply setting
the two equal to one another.

$$ \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{2} $$

This means $x = 2$, and our limits of integration are:

$$ \frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 2 $$

Now let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{2}{1 - \frac{1}{3}x\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(x - \frac{1}{6}x^2\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left((2) - \frac{1}{6}(2)^2\right) - \left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{1}{6}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(2 - \frac{2}{3}\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{24}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[2 - \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{24}\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{7}{8}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{7}{4}\pi} $$

**10.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = \dfrac{1}{x}$, $y = \dfrac{1}{3}$ and
$x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Same as 9, but now rotating about the $x$-axis, which means our functions must
be in terms of $f(y)$, and we need to adjust:

$$ y = \frac{1}{x} $$

$$ yx = 1 $$

$$ x = \frac{1}{y} $$

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our Area formula must be in terms of
_width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $x$-axis, our radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

And our width is simply the adjusted function we got earlier, leaving our Area
formula as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{1}{y}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

Looking at the graph, we can see that the first disk actually starts at the
given function of $y = \dfrac{1}{3}$. The last disk occurs where
$x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and $x = \dfrac{1}{y}$ meet. Setting them equal makes the
last limit clear:

$$ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{y} $$

This means $y = 2$ is our last limit and our limits of integration are:

$$ \frac{1}{3} \leq y \leq 2 $$

Now let's find our volume:

$$ V = \int_{\frac{1}{3}}^{2}{2\pi\, dy} $$

$$ V = \left. \left(2\pi y\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{3}}^{2} $$

$$ V = \left[\left(2\pi (2)\right) - \left(2\pi \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi - \frac{2}{3}\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{10}{3}\pi} $$

**11.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 6 - 2x$, $y = 3 + x$ and $x = 3$ about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, our functions must be in terms of
$f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, the Area formula must be expressed
in terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $y$-axis, the radius is simply $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

In order to find the height, normally we could just look at the graph. Looking
at the graph, we can see that our top function is $y = 3 + x$ and our bottom
function is $y = 6 - 2x$.

Thusly our height is:

$$ \text{height} = (3 + x) - (6 - 2x) $$

$$ \text{height} = 3 + x - 6 + 2x $$

$$ \text{height} = 3x - 3 $$

Leaving our area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)(3x - 3) $$

Distribute/simplify:

$$ A(x) = 6\pi(x)(x - 1) $$

$$ A(x) = 6\pi\left(x^2 - x\right) $$

Let's now find our limits of integration.

Looking at the graph, we can see that the first disk of the cylinder starts at
where the two given functions intersect.

$$ 6 - 2x = 3 + x $$

$$ -3x = -3 $$

$$ x = 1 $$

And our last disk is given to us in the boundary function of $x = 3$. This means
our limits of integration are:

$$ 1 \leq x \leq 3 $$

So our volume is therefore:

$$ V = 6\pi\int_{1}^{3}{x^2 - x\, dx} $$

$$ V = 6\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{1}^{3} $$

$$ V = 6\pi \left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(3)^3 - \frac{1}{2}(3)^2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(1)^3 - \frac{1}{2}(1)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 6\pi \left[9 - \frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\right] $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left(\frac{14}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 28\pi} $$

**12.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 6 - 2x$, $y = 3 + x$ and $y = 6$ about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our functions must be in terms of
$f(y)$, which they are not, we'll need to adjust.

$$ y = 6 - 2x $$

$$ y - 6 = -2x $$

$$ x = 3 - \frac{1}{2}y $$

And also:

$$ y = 3 + x $$

$$ x = y - 3 $$

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our Area formula must be expressed
in terms of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $x$-axis, our radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Looking at our graph, we can see that our right most function is $x = y - 3$ and
our left most function is $x = 3 - \dfrac{1}{2}y$, we just have to subtract the
leftmost from the rightmost to get the width:

$$ \text{width} = (y - 3) - \left(3 - \frac{1}{2}y\right) $$

$$ \text{width} = y - 3 - 3 + \frac{1}{2}y $$

$$ \text{width} = \frac{3}{2}y - 6 $$

This leaves our Area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{3}{2}y - 6\right) $$

Distributed/simplified:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\frac{3}{2}y^2 - 6y\right) $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

Looking at the graph, we can see that the last disk of the cylinder is defined
for us by the bounding function of $y = 6$. The beginning disk will be where the
two other bounding functions intersect:

$$ 3 - \frac{1}{2}y = y - 3 $$

$$ 6 = \frac{3}{2}y $$

$$ 12 = 3y $$

$$ 4 = y $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 4 \leq y \leq 6 $$

We can now find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{4}^{6}{\frac{3}{2}y^2 - 6y\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{2}y^3 - 3y^2\right) \right|_{4}^{6} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}(6)^3 - 3(6)^2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}(4)^3 - 3(4)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[(108 - 108) - (32 - 48)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(-32 + 48) $$

$$ V = 2\pi(16) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 32\pi} $$

**13.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = x^2 - 6x + 11$ and $y = 6$ about the
$y$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, our functions must be in terms of
$f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, our Area formula needs to be in
terms of _height_.

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $y$-axis, the radius is simply $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Looking at the graph, we can see that the top function is $y = 6$ and the bottom
function is $y = x^2 - 6x + 11$, so we simply subtract the bottom function from
the top function to get the height:

$$ \text{height} = 6 - \left(x^2 - 6x + 11\right) $$

$$ \text{height} = 6 - x^2 + 6x - 11 $$

$$ \text{height} = -x^2 + 6x - 5 $$

$$ \text{height} = 6x - x^2 - 5 $$

This leaves our area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(6x - x^2 - 5\right) $$

Distributed:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(6x^2 - x^3 - 5x\right) $$

Let's find our limits of integration. To find both our limits, we can set the
two given boundary functions equal to each other. Because one of them is a
quadratic, it should give us two values that are our limits.

$$ x^2 - 6x + 11 = 6 $$

$$ x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 $$

$$ (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 1 \leq x \leq 5 $$

Thusly our Volume is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{1}^{5}{6x^2 - x^3 - 5x\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(2x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{5}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(2(5)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(5)^4 - \frac{5}{2}(5)^2\right) - \left(2(1)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(1)^4 - \frac{5}{2}(1)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(250 - \frac{625}{4} - \frac{125}{2}\right) - \left(2 - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{5}{2}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[250 - \frac{625}{4} - \frac{125}{2} - 2 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{5}{2}\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(32) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 64\pi} $$

**14.** Rotate the regioin bounded by $x = y^2 - 8y + 19$ and $x = 2y + 3$ about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our functions must be expressions of
$f(y)$, which they are, so no adjustments are necessary.

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, the Area function must be expressed
in terms of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because we are rotating about the major $x$-axis, the radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Looking at our graph, we can see that the rightmost function is $x = 2y + 3$ and
the leftmost function is $x = y^2 - 8y + 19$. Our width is simply the leftmost
function subtracted from the rightmost function:

$$ \text{width} = (2y + 3) - \left(y^2 - 8y + 19\right) $$

$$ \text{width} = 2y + 3 - y^2 + 8y - 19 $$

$$ \text{width} = -y^2 + 10y - 16 $$

$$ \text{width} = 10y - y^2 - 16 $$

Leaving our area formula as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(10y - y^2 - 16\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(10y^2 - y^3 - 16y\right) $$

Let's find our limits of integration. Again, by setting the two functions equal
to each other, because one is a quadratic, we should get two coordinates for $y$
that are our limits:

$$ y^2 - 8y + 19 = 2y + 3 $$

$$ y^2 - 10y + 16 = 0 $$

$$ (y - 8)(y - 2) = 0 $$

Therefore our limits of integration are:

$$ 2 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Now we can find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{2}^{8}{10y^2 - y^3 - 16y\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{10}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 - 8y^2\right) \right|_{2}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{10}{3}(8)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(8)^4 - 8(8)^2\right) - \left(\frac{10}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - 8(2)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{5120}{3} - 1024 - 512\right) - \left(\frac{80}{3} - 4 - 32\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\frac{5120}{3} - 1024 - 512 - \frac{80}{3} + 4 + 32\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(180) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 360\pi} $$

**15.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $y = 8$ and the $y$-axis
about the

**(a)** line $x = 3$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our functions must be
expressions of $f(x)$, which they are so no adjustments are necessary.

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be an
expression of _height_.

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The only difference between this problem and the previous is the axis of
rotation is no longer a major one. In this case the minor $y$-axis of $x = 3$
sits to the _right_ of our cylinder defined by the boundary functions, so the
radius is:

$$ \text{radius } = 3 - x $$

This means our Area function is defined as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(3 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Looking at the graph, we can see that the height is given to us by the two
boundary functions $y = 2x^2$ and $y = 8$, so our Area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(3 - x)\left(8 - 2x^2\right) $$

Distributing:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(2x^3 - 6x^2 - 8x + 24\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 4\pi\left(x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12\right) $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

One of the limits is obviously given to us in the form of $x = 0$, the other can
be found by soving for $x$ from the parabola boundary given and setting it equal
to the other of $y = 8$:

$$ 2x^2 = 8 $$

$$ x^2 = 4 $$

$$ x = \pm 2 $$

We omit the $\pm$ because the region is bounded by the $y$-axis in $x = 0$.
Thusly our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

Let's now solve for the volume:

$$ V = 4\pi\int_{0}^{2}{x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12\, dx} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4 - x^3 - 2x^2 + 12x\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - (2)^3 - 2(2)^2 + 12(2)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - (0)^3 - 2(0)^2 + 12(0)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi(4 - 8 - 8 + 24) $$

$$ V = 4\pi(12) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 48\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = -2$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our functions must be
expressions of $f(x)$, which they are so no adjustments are necessary.

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be an
expression of _height_.

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our radius here is affected by the fact that our axis of rotation is now a
negative value. Since the radius of a cylinder can never be negative, we'll
subtract this axis value from our shell:

$$ \text{radius} = x - (-2) = x + 2 $$

This changes our Area to:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is the same as part $a$, leaving us at:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left(8 - 2x^2\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(8x - 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 16\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 4\pi\left(4x - x^3 - 2x^2 + 8\right) $$

The limits of integration are also the same as part a for the same
aforementioned reasoning:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

And so now let's find the volume:

$$ V = 4\pi\int_{0}^{2}{4x - x^3 - 2x^2 + 8\, dx} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left. \left(2x^2 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 + 8x\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[\left(2(2)^2 - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - \frac{2}{3}(2)^3 + 8(2)\right) - \left(2(0)^2 - \frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - \frac{2}{3}(0)^3 + 8(0)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left(8 - 4 - \frac{16}{3} + 16\right) $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left(\frac{44}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{176}{3}\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $y = 11$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our functions must be in terms
of $f(y)$, which they are not, we'll need to adjust:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = x^2 $$

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

We omit the $\pm$ here and only include the positive because we are bounded by
$x = 0$, which limits our shape the the right-hand side (the positive side) of
the parabola.

$$ x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

For ease of use later, we'll express this as an exponential fraction:

$$ x = \left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

The other boundary functions we leave the same, but will come up later when we
find our limits of integration.

Because we are rotating about a minor $x$-axis, our Area function must be an
expression of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation is above the major $x$-axis, we simply subtract $y$
from the given $y = 11$. This adjusts our area function to:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(11 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our width is in this case simply the rightmost boundary function minus the
leftmost boundary function. This leaves our Area function adjusted as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(11 - y)\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - 0\right] $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(11 - y)\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

Distribute (a little clunky, but it will make integration easier later on):

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left(11y^{\frac{1}{2}} - y^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) $$

Let's find the limits of integration:

One of the limits is given to us in the form of $y = 8$, the other limit can be
found by setting the two boundary functions equal to each other and solving for
$y$:

$$ \left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 0 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = 0 $$

$$ y = 0 $$

Thusly our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

The volume is:

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\int_{0}^{8}{11y^{\frac{1}{2}} - y^{\frac{3}{2}}\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left. \left(\frac{22}{3}y^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{2}{5}y^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left[\left(\frac{22}{3}(8)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{22}{3}(0)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left(\frac{22}{3}(8)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left(\frac{992}{15}\right)(2)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{992}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{1984}{15}\pi} $$

**(d)** line $y = -4$

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our functions must be in terms
of $f(y)$, which they are not, we'll need to adjust:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = x^2 $$

$$ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

We omit the $\pm$ here and only include the positive because we are bounded by
$x = 0$, which limits our shape the the right-hand side (the positive side) of
the parabola.

$$ x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}y} $$

For ease of use later, we'll express this as an exponential fraction:

$$ x = \left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

The other boundary functions we leave the same, but will come up later when we
find our limits of integration.

Because we are rotating about a minor $x$-axis, our Area function must be an
expression of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation is below the major $x$-axis, we will subtract $-4$
from the shell $y$. This adjusts our area function to:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - (-4))\left(\text{width}\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 4)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width is the same as part $c$ leaving our Area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 4)\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

Distribute (again, kind of clunky):

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left(y^{\frac{3}{2}} + 4y^{\frac{1}{2}}\right) $$

Our limits of integration don't change from part c:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Our volume is therefore:

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\int_{0}^{8}{y^{\frac{3}{2}} + 4y^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left. \left(\frac{2}{5}y^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{8}{3}y^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left[\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{8}{3}(8)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{8}{3}(0)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{8}{3}(8)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\pi\left(\frac{1408}{15}\right)(2)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{1408}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{2816}{15}\pi} $$

**16.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $x = y^3$, $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis
about the

**(a)** line $x = 10$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our functions must be expressed
in terms of $f(x)$, which they are not, let's adjust:

$$ x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x}$$

$$ y = x^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation is to the right of the graphed shape, our radius is
the given $x = 10$ minus $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(10 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

And our height is the top most function $y = x^{\frac{1}{3}}$ minus the bottom
most function of $y = 0$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(10 - x)\left(x^{\frac{1}{3}} - 0\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(10 - x)\left(x^{\frac{1}{3}}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(10x^{\frac{1}{3}} - x^{\frac{4}{3}}\right) $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

One limit is given in terms of $x = 8$, the other can be found by plugging in
$y = 0$ into our adjusted boundary formula:

$$ y = x^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

$$ x^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0 $$

$$ x = 0 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 8 $$

Our volume is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{8}{10x^{\frac{1}{3}} - x^{\frac{4}{3}}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{30}{4}x^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{3}{7}x^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{30}{4}(8)^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) - \left(\frac{30}{4}(0)^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{3}{7}(0)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{30}{4}(8)^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}}\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{456}{7}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{912}{7}\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = -3$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our functions must be expressed
in terms of $f(x)$, which they are not, let's adjust:

$$ x = y^3 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x}$$

$$ y = x^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation is to the left of the graphed shape, our radius is
$x$ minus the given $x = -3$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x - (-3))\left(\text{height}\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 3)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is the same as part a:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 3)\left(x^{\frac{1}{3}}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x^{\frac{4}{3}} + 3x^{\frac{1}{3}}\right) $$

Our limits is the same as part a as well:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 8 $$

So our volume is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{8}{x^{\frac{4}{3}} + 3x^{\frac{1}{3}}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{3}{7}x^{\frac{7}{3}} + \frac{9}{4}x^{\frac{4}{3}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}} + \frac{9}{4}(8)^{\frac{4}{3}}\right) - \left(\frac{3}{7}(0)^{\frac{7}{3}} + \frac{9}{4}(0)^{\frac{4}{3}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}} + \frac{9}{4}(8)^{\frac{4}{3}}\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{636}{7}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{1272}{7}\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $y = 3$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our functions must be
expressions of $f(y)$, which they are, no adjustments are necessary.

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our Area must be an expression
of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation is above the cylinder's boundary functions, the
radius is $3 - y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(3 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

And the width is the rightmost function of $x = 8$ minus the leftmost function
of $x = y^3$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(3 - y)\left(8 - y^3\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(y^4 - 3y^3 - 8y + 24\right) $$

Let's find our limits of integration. One is already given in the form of
$y = 0$, and the other can be found by setting the other two boundary functions
equal to one another:

$$ y^3 = 8 $$

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{8} $$

$$ y = 2 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

Our volume therefore is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{y^4 - 3y^3 - 8y + 24\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{5}y^5 - \frac{3}{4}y^4 - 4y^2 + 24y\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{5}(2)^5 - \frac{3}{4}(2)^4 - 4(2)^2 + 24(2)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{5}(0)^5 - \frac{3}{4}(0)^4 - 4(0)^2 + 24(0)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{32}{5} - 12 - 16 + 48\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{132}{5}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{264}{5}\pi} $$

**(d)** line $y = -4$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our functions must be
expressions of $f(y)$, which they are, no adjustments are necessary.

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our Area must be an expression
of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation is below the cylinder's boundary functions, the
radius is $y - (-4)$ or $y + 4$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 4)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

And the width is the rightmost function of $x = 8$ minus the leftmost function
of $x = y^3$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 4)\left(8 - y^3\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(8y - y^4 - 4y^3 + 32\right) $$

The limits of integration are the same as part c:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

Our volume therefore is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{8y - y^4 - 4y^3 + 32\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(4y^2 - \frac{1}{5}y^5 - y^4 + 32y\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(4(2)^2 - \frac{1}{5}(2)^5 - (2)^4 + 32(2)\right) - \left(4(0)^2 - \frac{1}{5}(0)^5 - (0)^4 + 32(0)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(16 - \frac{32}{5} - 16 + 64\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{288}{5}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{576}{5}\pi} $$

**17.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 6y + 9$ and
$x = -y^2 + 6y - 1$ about the

**(a)** line $y = 7$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about a minor $x$-axis, the functions must be expressed
as forms of $f(y)$, which they are, so no adjustment is needed.

Because we are rotating about a minor $x$-axis, the Area must be expressed in
terms of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The radius is simply $7 - y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(7 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The rightmost function is not apparent in the graph, so taking testpoints within
the given region will help us determine which is the rightmost function and
ultimately help us find the width. To the find the region, we'll have to find
the limits of integration a bit early by setting the two functions equal to one
another.

$$ y^2 - 6y + 9 = -y^2 + 6y - 1 $$

$$ 2y^2 - 12y + 10 = 0 $$

$$ 2\left(y^2 - 6y + 5\right) = 0 $$

$$ 2(y - 5)(y - 1) = 0 $$

So our limits of integration and the boundary in which we can test for
rightmost/leftmost is:

$$ 1 \leq y \leq 5 $$

Let's take $y = 3$ and test which is greater than the other:

$$ y^2 - 6y + 9 \stackrel{?}{=} -y^2 + 6y - 1 $$

$$ (3)^2 - 6(3) + 9 \stackrel{?}{=} -(3)^2 + 6(3) - 1 $$

$$ 9 - 18 + 9 \stackrel{?}{=} -9 + 18 - 1 $$

$$ 0 < 8 $$

So our rightmost function is $-y^2 + 6y - 1$ and our width is the leftmost
function subtracted from the rightmost, so our width is:

$$ \text{width} = -y^2 + 6y - 1 - \left(y^2 - 6y + 9\right) $$

$$ \text{width} = -y^2 + 6y - 1 - y^2 + 6y - 9 $$

$$ \text{width} = -2y^2 + 12y - 10 $$

This leaves our area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(7 - y)\left(-2y^2 + 12y - 10\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(2y^3 - 26y^2 + 94y - 70\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 4\pi\left(y^3 - 13y^2 + 47y - 35\right) $$

We already found the limits of integration, so let's find our volume:

$$ V = 4\pi\int_{1}^{5}{y^3 - 13y^2 + 47y - 35\, dy} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{4}y^4 - \frac{13}{3}y^3 + \frac{47}{2}y^2 - 35y\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(5)^4 - \frac{13}{3}(5)^3 + \frac{47}{2}(5)^2 - 35(5)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(1)^4 - \frac{13}{3}(1)^3 + \frac{47}{2}(1)^2 - 35(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left(\frac{128}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512}{3}\pi} $$

**(b)** line $y = -2$

**Solution**

We can take a lot from part a here, we just need to adjust the radius, which is
$y - (-2)$ or $y + 2$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 2)\left(-2y^2 + 12y - 10\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(8y^2 - 2y^3 + 14y - 20\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 4\pi\left(4y^2 - y^3 + 7y - 10\right) $$

Our Volume is:

$$ V = 4\pi\int_{1}^{5}{4y^2 - y^3 + 7y - 10\, dy} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left. \left(\frac{4}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 + \frac{7}{2}y^2 - 10y\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left[\left(\frac{4}{3}(5)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(5)^4 + \frac{7}{2}(5)^2 - 10(5)\right) - \left(\frac{4}{3}(1)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(1)^4 + \frac{7}{2}(1)^2 - 10(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi\left(\frac{160}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{640}{3}\pi} $$

**18.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the triangle with vertices $(3, 2)$, $(7, 2)$ and $(7, 14)$
about the

**(a)** line $x = 12$

**Solution**

In order to solve this, we're going to need to establish what our boundary
functions are based off the points given. Two of them are relative straight
forward since the are straight lines and have no slope to them, those are:

$$ y = 2 $$

And:

$$ x = 7 $$

The hypotenuse of the triangle can be found by determining the slope, recall
that the slope formula is:

$$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

The top point of the hypotenuse is $(7, 14)$ and the bottom point of the
hypotenuse is $(3, 2)$, so our slope formula becomes:

$$ m = \frac{14 - 2}{7 - 3} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 $$

Now, in order to find our third boundary function, we'll have to use this value
for the slope and express this line by expressing it in point slope form. Recall
that the point slope form is:

$$ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $$

Plugging our values in we find that our third boundary function is:

$$ y - 2 = 3(x - 3) $$

$$ y - 2 = 3x - 9 $$

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

So we have our three boundary functions now which will make answering this
problem statement much like we answered the others. To reiterate, our three
boundary functions are:

$$ y = 2 $$

$$ x = 7 $$

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

Now, we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, which means these functions have to
be in the form of $f(x)$, which they are, so no need to adjust them.

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our radius is simply $12 - x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(12 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our topmost function is $y = 3x - 7$ and our bottom function is $y = 2$ so our
area formula with the height becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(12 - x)(3x - 7 - 2) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(12 - x)(3x - 9) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(45x - 3x^2 - 108\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 6\pi\left(15x - x^2 - 36\right) $$

Let's find our limits of integration.

One of our limits we already found in the form of $x = 7$, the other can be
found by setting our other two boundary functions equal to one another and
solving for $x$:

$$ 3x - 7 = 2 $$

$$ 3x = 9 $$

$$ x = 3 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 3 \leq x \leq 7 $$

And our volume is:

$$ V = 6\pi\int_{3}^{7}{15x - x^2 - 36\, dx} $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left. \left(\frac{15}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 - 36x\right) \right|_{3}^{7} $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left[\left(\frac{15}{2}(7)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(7)^3 - 36(7)\right) - \left(\frac{15}{2}(3)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(3)^3 - 36(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left(\frac{152}{3}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{912}{3}\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = 304\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = 2$

**Solution**

So now the hard work of a is out of the way and we can go through these quicker,
this is pretty much the same right up until we determine the radius, which in
this case is just $x - 2$ since it lies to the _left_ of the boundary functions
and not _right_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x - 2)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is the same:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x - 2)(3x - 9) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(3x^2 - 15x + 18\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 6\pi\left(x^2 - 5x + 6\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same, so we just have to find the volume:

$$ V = 6\pi\int_{3}^{7}{x^2 - 5x + 6\, dx} $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{5}{2}x^2 + 6x\right) \right|_{3}^{7} $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(7)^3 - \frac{5}{2}(7)^2 + 6(7)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(3)^3 - \frac{5}{2}(3)^2 + 6(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left(\frac{88}{3}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{528}{3}\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = 176\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $x = -1$

**Solution**

Again, very similar to parts a and b up until we have to find the radius, which
is $x - (-1)$ or $x + 1$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Again, height is the same:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)(3x - 9) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(3x^2 - 6x - 9\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 6\pi\left(x^2 - 2x - 3\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same, so we can just find our volume:

$$ V = 6\pi\int_{3}^{7}{x^2 - 2x - 3\, dx} $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - x^2 - 3x\right) \right|_{3}^{7} $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(7)^3 - (7)^2 - 3(7)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(3)^3 - (3)^2 - 3(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 6\pi\left(\frac{160}{3}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{960}{3}\pi $$

$$ \boxed{V = 320\pi} $$

**(d)** line $y = 14$

**Solution**

Here finally our axis of rotation changes orientation, so we'll need to
re-evaluate here a bit. Firstly, let's re-establish our found boundary
functions:

$$ y = 2 $$

$$ x = 7 $$

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our functions must be
expressions of $f(y)$, let's adjust the hypotenuse boundary function to account
for this.

$$ y = 3x - 7 $$

$$ y + 7 = 3x $$

$$ x = \frac{y + 7}{3} $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our Area function must be an
expression of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Since our axis of rotation is _above_ the boundary functions, our radius is
simply $14 - y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(14 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our width is the rightmost function minus the leftmost function, so our Area
function becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(14 - y)\left(7 - \frac{y + 7}{3}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(14 - y)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)(21 - (y + 7)) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi(14 - y)(21 - y - 7) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi(14 - y)(14 - y) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left(y^2 - 28y + 196\right) $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

One of our limits is given in terms of $y = 2$, our other can be found by
setting the two boundary functions equal to one another.

$$ \frac{y + 7}{3} = 7 $$

$$ y + 7 = 21 $$

$$ y = 14 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 2 \leq y \leq 14 $$

Let's find the volume:

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\int_{2}^{14}{y^2 - 28y + 196\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{3}y^3 - 14y^2 + 196y\right) \right|_{2}^{14} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(14)^3 - 14(14)^2 + 196(14)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - 14(2)^2 + 196(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi(576) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 384\pi} $$

**(e)** line $y = 1$

**Solution**

This is similar to part d except when we get to the radius, which because the
axis of rotation sits _below_ the boundary functions is $y - 1$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - 1)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our width is the same as part d:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - 1)\left(7 - \frac{y + 7}{3}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - 1)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)(21 - (y + 7)) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi(y - 1)(21 - y - 7) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi(y - 1)(14 - y) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left(15y - y^2 - 14\right) $$

Our limits of integration from part d are the same so we can just start the
volume now:

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\int_{2}^{14}{15y - y^2 - 14\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left. \left(\frac{15}{2}y^2 - \frac{1}{3}y^3 - 14y\right) \right|_{2}^{14} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left[\left(\frac{15}{2}(14)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(14)^3 - 14(14)\right) - \left(\frac{15}{2}(2)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - 14(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi(360) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 240\pi} $$

**(f)** line $y = -3$

**Solution**

Same as parts d and e except, of course, when we get to the radius, which is
$y - (-3)$ or $y + 3$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 3)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our width is the same as parts d and e:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 3)\left(7 - \frac{y + 7}{3}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi(y + 3)(21 - (y + 7)) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi(y + 3)(14 - y) $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left(11y - y^2 + 42\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same from parts d and e so we can start
finding our volume:

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\int_{2}^{14}{11y - y^2 + 42\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left. \left(\frac{11}{2}y^2 - \frac{1}{3}y^3 + 42y\right) \right|_{2}^{14} $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi\left[\left(\frac{11}{2}(14)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(14)^3 + 42(14)\right) - \left(\frac{11}{2}(2)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(2)^3 + 42(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2}{3}\pi(648) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 432\pi} $$

**19.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $y = 4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}$, $y = 2$,
$x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and $x = 3$ about the

**(a)** line $x = 5$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our boundary functions must be
in the form of $f(x)$, which they are, so no adjustment needed.

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because or axis of rotation sits to the _right_ of our boundary functions, the
radius is simply $5 - x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(5 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The height is the top function $y = 4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}$ minus the bottom
function $y = 2$, so our area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(5 - x)\left(4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 2\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(5 - x)\left(2 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(10 - 2x + 15\mathbf{e}^{-x} -3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

In this case, we are actually given the limits of integration in the boundary
functions. This means our limits of integration are:

$$ \frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 3 $$

Let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{10 - 2x + 15\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{10 - 2x + 15\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} - \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{10 - 2x + 15\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} - 3\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} $$

We'll need to understand the product rule and reverse it in order to find the
anti-derivative of the last term.

Recall that the product rule essentially states:

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)g(x)\right] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) $$

If we think about our integrand in this fashion we get:

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\left[x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right] = (x)'\left(\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) + (x)\left(\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right)' $$

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\left[x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right] = (1)\left(\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) + (x)\left(-\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\left[x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right] = \mathbf{e}^{-x} - x\mathbf{e}^{-x} $$

Since we are trying to find the integral of $x\mathbf{e}^{-x}$ we'll have to
solve for that:

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\left[x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right] - \mathbf{e}^{-x} = -x\mathbf{e}^{-x} $$

$$ -\frac{d}{dx}\left[x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right] + \mathbf{e}^{-x} = x\mathbf{e}^{-x} $$

Now we can take our full anti-derivative:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{10 - 2x + 15\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} - 3\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} $$

$$ -3\int{x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} = -3\left(-x\mathbf{e}^{-x} - \mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) + c = 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} + c $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left[\left(10x - x^2 - 15\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) + \left(3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right)\right] \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(10x - x^2 + 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 12\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(10(3) - (3)^2 + 3(3)\mathbf{e}^{-(3)} - 12\mathbf{e}^{-(3)}\right) - \left(10\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\mathbf{e}^{-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} - 12\mathbf{e}^{-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(30 - 9 + 9\mathbf{e}^{-3} - 12\mathbf{e}^{-3}\right) - \left(5 - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} - 12\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[30 - 9 + 9\mathbf{e}^{-3} - 12\mathbf{e}^{-3} - 5 + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} + 12\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 2\pi\left(\frac{65}{4} - 3\mathbf{e}^{-3} + \frac{21}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)} $$

**(b)** line $x = \dfrac{1}{4}$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our boundary functions must be
in the form of $f(x)$, which they are, so no adjustment needed.

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because or axis of rotation sits to the _left_ of our boundary functions, the
radius is simply $x - \dfrac{1}{4}$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x - \frac{1}{4}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The height is the top function $y = 4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}$ minus the bottom
function $y = 2$, so our area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(5 - x)\left(4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 2\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x - \frac{1}{4}\right)\left(4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 2\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x - \frac{1}{4}\right)\left(2 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(2x - \frac{1}{2} + 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} + \frac{3}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(2x - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same as part a and we've done the hard work of
figuring out the anti-derivative of the last term as before, so we can find our
volume now:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{2x - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left[\left(x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{3}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) - \left(3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) \right] \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{15}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left((3)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(3) - \frac{15}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-(3)} - 3(3)\mathbf{e}^{-(3)}\right) - \left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{15}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} - 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\mathbf{e}^{-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(9 - \frac{3}{2} - \frac{15}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-3} - 9\mathbf{e}^{-3}\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{15}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[9 - \frac{3}{2} - \frac{15}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-3} - 9\mathbf{e}^{-3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{15}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 2\pi\left(\frac{15}{2} - \frac{51}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-3} + \frac{21}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)} $$

**\(c\)** line $x = -1$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our boundary functions must be
in the form of $f(x)$, which they are, so no adjustment needed.

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because or axis of rotation sits to the _left_ of our boundary functions, the
radius is simply $x - (-1)$ or $x + 1$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The height is the top function $y = 4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}$ minus the bottom
function $y = 2$, so our area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)\left(4 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 2\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)\left(2 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(2x + 2  + 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(2x + 2  + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) $$

Again, limits of integration are the same and the hard work of finding the
tricky anti-derivative is the same, so let's find our Volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3}{2x + 2 + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left[\left(x^2 + 2x - 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) -\left(3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} + 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right)\right] \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(x^2 + 2x - 3\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 3\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(x^2 + 2x - 3x\mathbf{e}^{-x} - 6\mathbf{e}^{-x}\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left((3)^2 + 2(3) - 3(3)\mathbf{e}^{-(3)} - 6\mathbf{e}^{-(3)}\right) - \left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\mathbf{e}^{-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} - 6\mathbf{e}^{-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(9 + 6 - 9\mathbf{e}^{-3} - 6\mathbf{e}^{-3}\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4} + 1 - \frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} - 6\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[9 + 6 - 9\mathbf{e}^{-3} - 6\mathbf{e}^{-3} - \frac{1}{4} - 1 + \frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}} + 6\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 2\pi\left(\frac{55}{4} - 15\mathbf{e}^{-3} + \frac{15}{2}\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)} $$

**20.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 8y + 19$ and $x = 2y + 3$
about the

**(a)** line $y = 9$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our boundary functions must be
in the form of $f(y)$, which they are, so no adjustment is needed.

Because we are roatating about a minor $x$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation is above the boundary graphs, our radius is $9 - y$
and our area function becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(9 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our rightmost function is $x = 2y + 3$ and our leftmost function is
$x = y^2 - 8y + 19$, so our area function becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(9 - y)\left[2y + 3 - \left(y^2 - 8y + 19\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(9 - y)\left[2y + 3 - y^2 + 8y - 19\right] $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(9 - y)\left(10y - y^2 - 16\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(y^3 - 19y^2 + 106y - 144\right) $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

Our limits of integration can be found by setting the two given boundary
functions equal to each other and solving for $y$, because one of them is a
quadratic, it should give us two coordinates for $y$ that are our limits of
integration.

$$ y^2 - 8y + 19 = 2y + 3 $$

$$ y^2 - 10y + 16 = 0 $$

$$ (y - 8)(y - 2) = 0 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 2 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{2}^{8}{y^3 - 19y^2 + 106y - 144\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{4}y^4 - \frac{19}{3}y^3 + 53y^2 - 144y\right) \right|_{2}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(8)^4 - \frac{19}{3}(8)^3 + 53(8)^2 - 144(8)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - \frac{19}{3}(2)^3 + 53(2)^2 - 144(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(144) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 288\pi} $$

**(b)** line $y = 1$

**Solution**

Similar to part a up until determining radius.

Since the axis of rotation now lies _below_ the boundary graphs, the radius is
$y - 1$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - 1)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width is the same as part a:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - 1)\left(10y - y^2 - 16\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(11y^2 - y^3 - 26y + 16\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same as part a, so we can now find our volume

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{2}^{8}{11y^2 - y^3 - 26y + 16\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{11}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 - 13y^2 + 16y\right) \right|_{2}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{11}{3}(8)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(8)^4 - 13(8)^2 + 16(8)\right) - \left(\frac{11}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - 13(2)^2 + 16(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(144) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 288\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $y = -3$

**Solution**

Again, very similar to part a and b, but the radius is different. Since the axis
of rotation lies below the boundary graphs, the radius is $y - (-3)$ or $y + 3$.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 3)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width is the same as part a:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 3)\left(10y - y^2 - 16\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(7y^2 - y^3 + 14y - 48\right) $$

The limits of integration are the same, so we can now find the volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{2}^{8}{7y^2 - y^3 + 14y - 48\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{7}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 + 7y^2 - 48y\right) \right|_{2}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{7}{3}(8)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(8)^4 + 7(8)^2 - 48(8)\right) - \left(\frac{7}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 + 7(2)^2 - 48(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(288) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 576\pi} $$

**21.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $y = 5 + \sqrt{x - 3}$, $y = 5$ and
$x = 4$ about the

**(a)** line $x = 9$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, our boundary functions must be
in the form of $f(x)$, which they are, so no adjustment is needed.

Because we are rotating about a minor $y$-axis, the Area function must be an
expression of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation sits to the _right_ of the boundary functions, our
radius is $9 - x$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(9 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our top function is $y = 5 + \sqrt{x - 3}$ while our bottom function is $y = 5$
so our area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(9 - x)\left(5 + \sqrt{x - 3} - 5\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(9 - x)\left(\sqrt{x - 3}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(9 - x)(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left[9(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} - x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right] $$

We'll obviously have to substitute later, but let's first find our limits of
integration.

We are given one of our limits in the boundary function of $x = 4$, adn we can
find the other limit by setting the two other boundary functions equal to each
other.

$$ 5 = 5 + \sqrt{x - 3} $$

$$ \sqrt{x - 3} = 0 $$

$$ x - 3 = 0 $$

$$ x = 3 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 3 \leq x \leq 4 $$

Let's set up our volume function:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{3}^{4}{9(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} - x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx} $$

Let's use substitution here:

$$ u = x - 3 \quad du = 1dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad du = dx $$

Recall that we'll need to change our limits of integration in order to do this
properly so:

$$ x = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad u = (3) - 3 = 0 $$

$$ x = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad u = (4) - 3 = 1 $$

Let's now split up the integral since the first term is easier to wrap our mind
around than the last:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{3}^{4}{9(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} - x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\int_{3}^{4}{9(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx} - \int_{3}^{4}{x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx}\right] $$

The first term is relatively simple to substitute here:

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\int_{0}^{1}{9(u)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} - \int_{3}^{4}{x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx}\right] $$

The second term would be simple but we still have an extra $x$, in order to
express it as $u$ though, return to your original substitution logic and recall
that:

$$ u = x - 3 $$

Solving for $x$ gives us the expression of $u$:

$$ u + 3 = x $$

$$ x = u + 3 $$

Understanding this gives us the following integral:

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\int_{0}^{1}{9(u)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} - \int_{0}^{1}{(u + 3)(u)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du}\right] $$

And now both integrals can be combined:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{9u^{\frac{1}{2}} - (u + 3)u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

Let's simplify the integrand before solving:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{9u^{\frac{1}{2}} - \left(u^{\frac{3}{2}} + 3u^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)\, du} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{9u^{\frac{1}{2}} - u^{\frac{3}{2}} - 3u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{6u^{\frac{1}{2}} - u^{\frac{3}{2}}\, du} $$

And from here we can find the anti-derivative and solve:

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(4u^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{2}{5}u^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{1} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(4(1)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{2}{5}(1)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) - \left(4(0)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{18}{5}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{36}{5}\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = 2$

**Solution**

Similar to part a except of course the radius, which since the axis of rotation
now lies to the _left_ of the boundary graphs is $x - 2$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x - 2)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is the same as part a:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x - 2)\left(\sqrt{x - 3}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x - 2)(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} - 2(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same, so let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{3}^{4}{x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} - 2(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx} $$

Substitution works the same:

$$ u = x - 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad du = dx $$

Limits change the same as well:

$$ x = 3 \quad u = (3) - 3 = 0 $$

$$ x = 4 \quad u = (4) - 3 = 1 $$

And also for another reference we'll need:

$$ u = x - 3 $$

$$ x = u + 3 $$

Our Volume therefore is changed to:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{(u + 3)u^{\frac{1}{2}} - 2u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

Simplify the integrand:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{u^{\frac{3}{2}} + 3u^{\frac{1}{2}} - 2u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{u^{\frac{3}{2}} + u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

Let's now find the anti-derivative and solve:

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{2}{5}u^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{2}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{1} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{2}{5}(1)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{2}{3}(1)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{2}{3}(0)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{16}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{32}{15}\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $x = -1$

**Solution**

And same as part b, just the axis of rotation is further left, changing our
radius, which now is $x - (-1)$ or $x + 1$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is the same as part a:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)\left(\sqrt{x - 3}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 1)(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} + (x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same so let's start finding our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{3}^{4}{x(x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}} + (x - 3)^{\frac{1}{2}}\, dx} $$

Substitution is the same:

$$ u = x - 3  \quad \Rightarrow \quad du = dx $$

Limits change the same:

$$ x = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad u = (3) - 3 = 0 $$

$$ x = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad u = (4) - 3 = 1 $$

And useful would be:

$$ u = x - 3 $$

$$ x = u + 3 $$

So our Volume becomes:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{(u + 3)u^{\frac{1}{2}} + u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

Simplifying integrand:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{u^{\frac{3}{2}} + 3u^{\frac{1}{2}} + u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}{u^{\frac{3}{2}} + 4u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

Find the anti-derivative and solve:

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{2}{5}u^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{8}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{1} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{2}{5}(1)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{8}{3}(1)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{8}{3}(0)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{46}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{92}{15}\pi} $$

**22.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $y = -x^2 - 10x + 6$ and
$y = 2x + 26$ about the

**(a)** line $x = 2$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our boundary functions must be
given in terms of $f(x)$, which they are, so no adjustments are needed.

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Since our axis of rotation sits to the _right_ of teh boundary functions, our
radius is $2 - x$, changing our area function to:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our top function is $y = -x^2 - 10x + 6$, while our bottom function is
$y = 2x + 26$, so our area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 - x)\left(-x^2 - 10x + 6 - (2x + 26)\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 - x)\left(-x^2 - 10x + 6 - 2x - 26\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 - x)\left(-x^2 - 12x - 20\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x^3 + 10x^2 - 4x - 40\right) $$

Our limits of integration can be found by setting our two given boundary
functions equal to one another, since one is a quadratic, we should get both
limits.

$$ -x^2 - 10x + 6 = 2x + 26 $$

$$ 0 = 2x + 26 + x^2 + 10x - 6 $$

$$ x^2 + 12x + 20 = 0 $$

$$ (x + 10)(x + 2) = 0 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ -10 \leq x \leq -2 $$

Let's set up our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-10}^{-2}{x^3 + 10x^2 - 4x - 40\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{10}{3}x^3 - 2x^2 - 40x\right) \right|_{-10}^{-2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(-2)^4 + \frac{10}{3}(-2)^3 - 2(-2)^2 - 40(-2)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(-10)^4 + \frac{10}{3}(-10)^3 - 2(-10)^2 - 40(-10)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{2048}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{4906}{3}\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = -1$

**Solution**

The radius changes here, note that our axis of rotation _bounds_ our other
boundary functions as it still sits to the _right_ of the boundary functions (it
just intersects them at one point, cutting off a portion of its potential
volume):

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(-1 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height remainds the same:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(-1 - x)\left(-x^2 - 12x - 20\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(x^3 + 13x^2 + 32x - 20\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same, so let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-10}^{-2}{x^3 + 13x^2 + 32x - 20\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{13}{3}x^3 + 16x^2 - 20x\right) \right|_{-10}^{-2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(-2)^4 + \frac{13}{3}(-2)^3 + 16(-2)^2 - 20(-2)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(-10)^4 + \frac{13}{3}(-10)^3 + 16(-10)^2 - 20(-10)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{320}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{640}{3}\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $x = -14$

NOTE: Paul has a typo, I'm assuming he means to go further negative here...

**Solution**

This sits fully to the _left_ of the boundary functions, so our area function
with the radius adjusted becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 14)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height remainds the same:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x + 14)\left(-x^2 - 12x - 20\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(-x^3 - 26x^2 - 188x - 280\right) $$

The limits of integration are the same, so let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-10}^{-2}{-x^3 - 26x^2 - 188x - 280\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(-\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{26}{3}x^3 - 94x^2 - 280x\right) \right|_{-10}^{-2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(-\frac{1}{4}(-2)^4 - \frac{26}{3}(-2)^3 - 94(-2)^2 - 280(-2)\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{4}(-10)^4 - \frac{26}{3}(-10)^3 - 94(-10)^2 - 280(-10)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{2048}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{4096}{3}\pi} $$

**23.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 10y + 27$ and $x = 11$
about the

**(a)** line $y = 10$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our boundary functions must be
in the form of $f(y)$, which they are, so no adjustment is needed.

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _width_.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because our axis of rotation sits _above_ the boundary graphs, our radius is
$10 - y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our rightmost function is $x = 11$ and our leftmost function is
$x = y^2 - 10y + 27$, so our area function becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left[11 - \left(y^2 - 10y + 27\right)\right] $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left[11 - y^2 + 10y - 27\right] $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(-y^2 + 10y - 16\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(y^3 - 20y^2 + 116y - 160\right) $$

We can find our limits by setting the two boundary functions equal to each
other, since one is a quadratic, this should yield our limits of integration:

$$ y^2 - 10y + 27 = 11 $$

$$ y^2 - 10y + 16 = 0 $$

$$ (y - 8)(y - 2) = 0 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 2 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Let's set up our volume formula:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{2}^{8}{y^3 - 20y^2 + 116y - 160\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{4}y^4 -\frac{20}{3}y^3 + 58y^2 - 160y\right) \right|_{2}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(8)^4 -\frac{20}{3}(8)^3 + 58(8)^2 - 160(8)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(2)^4 -\frac{20}{3}(2)^3 + 58(2)^2 - 160(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(180) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 360\pi} $$

**(b)** line $y = 1$

**Solution**

This changes the radius, the axis of rotation now sits _below_ the graphs,
intersecting granted, but still setting a sort of another boundary below the
majority of the graph's volume, thusly our area becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - 1)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The height is the same as part a:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y - 1)\left(-y^2 + 10y - 16\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(11y^2 - y^3 - 26y + 16\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same, so let's find the volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{2}^{8}{11y^2 - y^3 - 26y + 16\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{11}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 - 13y^2 + 16y\right) \right|_{2}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{11}{3}(8)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(8)^4 - 13(8)^2 + 16(8)\right) - \left(\frac{11}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - 13(2)^2 + 16(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(144) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 288\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $y = -3$

**Solution**

Again, this axis of rotation sits even further _below_ the boundary graphs than
in part b, so our area function becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 3)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The height is the same as part a:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y + 3)\left(-y^2 + 10y - 16\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(7y^2 - y^3 + 14y - 48\right) $$

Our limits of integration are the same, so let's find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{2}^{8}{7y^2 - y^3 + 14y - 48\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{7}{3}y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 + 7y^2 - 48y\right) \right|_{2}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{7}{3}(8)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(8)^4 + 7(8)^2 - 48(8)\right) - \left(\frac{7}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 + 7(2)^2 - 48(2)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(288) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 576\pi} $$

**24.** Use the method of cylinders to determine the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating the region bounded by $y = 2x^2 + 1$, $y = 7 - x$, $x = 3$
and $x = \dfrac{3}{2}$ about the

**(a)** line $x = 6$

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our boundary functions must be
in terms of $f(x)$, which they are, so no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be in
terms of _height_.

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our axis of rotation sits to the _right_ of the boundary functions, so our
radius is $6 - x$ and our area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(6 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our top function is $y = 2x^2 + 1$ and our bottom function is $y = 7 - x$. Be
careful here, within the given boundaries, this is the case, but is not outside
of those boundaries. So our area function becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(6 - x)\left[2x^2 + 1 - (7 - x)\right] $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(6 - x)\left[2x^2 + 1 - 7 + x\right] $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(6 - x)\left[2x^2 + x - 6\right] $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(11x^2 - 2x^3 + 12x - 36\right) $$

Our limits of integration are given to us:

$$ \frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq 3 $$

So our volume is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{\frac{3}{2}}^{3}{11x^2 - 2x^3 + 12x - 36\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{11}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^4 + 6x^2 - 36x\right) \right|_{\frac{3}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{11}{3}(3)^3 - \frac{1}{2}(3)^4 + 6(3)^2 - 36(3)\right) - \left(\frac{11}{3}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^3 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^4 + 6\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 36\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{1125}{32}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{1125}{16}\pi} $$

**(b)** line $x = 1$

**Solution**

This adjusts a few things, since the axis of rotation now is to the _left_ of
the two bounding functions $x = \dfrac{3}{2}$ and $x = 3$, this will change how
we evaluate the limits of integration as well as our height as well as our
radius.

Since our axis of rotation still sits to the _right_ of our remaining two
boundary functions, we can evaluate our area with the radius adjusted like so:

$$ A = 2\pi(1 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

This is where we flip the top/bottom functions for the height. This becomes
apparent if you look at the graph.

$$ A = 2\pi(1 - x)\left[7 - x - \left(2x^2 + 1\right)\right] $$

$$ A = 2\pi(1 - x)\left[7 - x - 2x^2 - 1\right] $$

$$ A = 2\pi(1 - x)\left[6 - x - 2x^2\right] $$

Distribute:

$$ A = 2\pi\left(2x^3 - x^2 - 7x + 6\right) $$

Our limits now become the difference between the two remaining boundary
functions for the reasons mentioned at the beginning of this section.

$$ 2x^2 + 1 = 7 - x $$

$$ 2x^2 + x - 6 = 0 $$

$$ x = \frac{-(1) \pm \sqrt{(1)^2 - 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)} $$

$$ x = \frac{-1 \pm 7}{4} $$

$$ x = -\frac{1}{4} \pm \frac{7}{4} $$

$$ x = -2 \text{, } x = \frac{3}{2} $$

So our limits of integration are now:

$$ -2 \leq x \leq \frac{3}{2} $$

Let's find the volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-2}^{\frac{3}{2}}{2x^3 - x^2 - 7x + 6\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{7}{2}x^2 + 6x\right) \right|_{-2}^{\frac{3}{2}} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^4 - \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^3 - \frac{7}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 6\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}(-2)^4 - \frac{1}{3}(-2)^3 - \frac{7}{2}(-2)^2 + 6(-2)\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{1715}{48}\pi} $$

**\(c\)** line $x = -2$

**Solution**

Now, the axis of rotation is completely to the _left_ of all four given boundary
functions. This changes also because the height is determined differently
depending on which boundary we're in. Thusly not only does the radius change
(for both), but also the height and limits of integration change as well. This
essentially is two volume functions added together, so let's go through this
carefully. Firstly, we'll need two different areas:

$$ A_1(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left[7 - x - \left(2x^2 + 1\right)\right] $$

$$ A_2(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left[2x^2 + 1 - (7 - x)\right] $$

Let's simplify and destribute these:

$$ A_1(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left[7 - x - 2x^2 - 1\right] $$

$$ A_1(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left[6 - x - 2x^2\right] $$

$$ A_1(x) = 2\pi\left(4x - 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 12\right) $$

$$ A_2(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left[2x^2 + 1 - 7 + x\right] $$

$$ A_2(x) = 2\pi(x + 2)\left(2x^2 + x - 6\right) $$

$$ A_2(x) = 2\pi\left(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x - 12\right) $$

Our limits of integration also interestingly change depending on which area we
are working with, for the first area, we take the limits from part b:

$$ -2 \leq x \leq \frac{3}{2} $$

While for the second area we use the limits from part a:

$$ \frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq 3 $$

With all this in mind, we can write our Volume function as an addition of two
integrals:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-2}^{\frac{3}{2}}{4x - 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 12\, dx} + 2\pi\int_{\frac{3}{2}}^{3}{2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x - 12\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(2x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^4 - \frac{5}{3}x^3 + 12x\right) \right|_{-2}^{\frac{3}{2}} + 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 + \frac{5}{3}x^3 - 2x^2 - 12x\right) \right|_{\frac{3}{2}}^{3} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^4 - \frac{5}{3}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^3 + 12\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)\right) - \left(2(-2)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(-2)^4 - \frac{5}{3}(-2)^3 + 12(-2)\right)\right] + 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}(3)^4 + \frac{5}{3}(3)^3 - 2(3)^2 - 12(3)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^4 + \frac{5}{3}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^3 - 2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{3401}{24}\pi} $$
