# Section 6.4 : Volume With Cylinders

In the previous section we started looking at finding volumes of solids of
revolution. In that section we took cross sections that were rings or disks,
found the cross-sectional area and then used the following formulas to find the
volume of the solid.

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx}  \quad V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

In the previous section we only used cross sections that were in the shape of a
disk or a ring. This however does not always need to be the case. We can use any
shape for the cross sections as long as it can be expanded or contracted to
completely cover the solid we’re looking at. This is a good thing because as our
first example will show us we can't always use rings/disks.

---

**Example 1** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = (x - 1)(x - 3)^2$ and the $x$-axis about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

As we did in the previous section, let's first graph the bounded region and
solid. Note that the bounded region here is the shaded portion shown. The curve
is extended out a little past this for the purposes of illustrating what the
curve looks like.

![image 6.4_2](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image002.gif)

So, we've basically got something that’s roughly doughnut shaped. If we were to
use rings on this solid here is what a typical ring would look like.

This leads to several problems. First, both the inner and outer radius are
defined by the same function. This, in itself, can be dealt with on occasion as
we saw in a example in the
[**Area Between Curves**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/AreaBetweenCurves.aspx#IntApps_Area_Ex6)
section. However, this usually means more work than other methods so it's often
not the best approach.

This leads to the second problem we got here. In order to use rings we would
need to put this function into the form $x = f(y)$. That is NOT easy in general
for a cubic polynomial and in other cases may not even be possible to do. Even
when it is possible to do this the resulting equation is often significantly
messier than the original which can also cause problems.

The last problem with rings in this case is not so much a problem as it's just
added work. If we were to use rings the limit would be $y$ limits and this means
that we will need to know how high the graph goes. To this point the limits of
integration have always been intersection points that were fairly easy to find.
However, in this case the highest point is not an intersection point, but
instead a relative maximum. We spent several sections in the Applications of
Derivatives chapter talking about how to find maximum values of functions.
However, finding them can, on occasion, take some work.

So, we've seen three problems with rings in this case that will either increase
our work load or outright prevent us from using rings.

What we need to do is to find a different way to cut the solid that will give us
a cross-sectional area that we can work with. One way to do this is to think of
our solid as a lump of cookie dough and instead of cutting it perpendicular to
the axis of rotation we could instead center a cylindrical cookie cutter on the
axis of rotation and push this down into the solid. Doing this would give the
following picture,

![image 6.4_3](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image003.gif)

![image 6.4_4](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image004.gif)

Doing this gives us a cylinder or shell in the object and we can easily find its
surface area. The surface area of this cylinder is,

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(x)\left((x - 1)(x - 3)^2\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(x^4 - 7x^3 + 15x^2 - 9x\right) $$

Notice as well that as we increase the radius of the cylinder we will completely
cover the solid and so we can use this in our formula to find the volume of this
solid. All we need are limits of integration. The first cylinder will cut into
the solid at $x = 1$ and as we increase $x$ to $x = 3$

we will completely cover both sides of the solid since expanding the cylinder in
one direction will automatically expand it in the other direction as well.

The volume of this solid is then,

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{3}{x^4 - 7x^3 + 15x^2 - 9x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{7}{4}x^4 + 5x^3 - \frac{9}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{1}^{3} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{24\pi}{5} $$

---

The method used in the last example is called the **method of cylinders** or
**method of shells**. The formula for the area in all cases will be,

> $$ A = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

There are a couple of important differences between this method and the method
of rings/disks that we should note before moving on. First, rotation about a
vertical axis will give an area that is a function of $x$ and rotation about a
horizontal axis will give an area that is a function of $y$.

This is exactly opposite of the method of rings/disks.

Second, we don’t take the complete range of x or y for the limits of integration
as we did in the previous section. Instead we take a range of $x$ or $y$ that
will cover one side of the solid. As we noted in the first example if we expand
out the radius to cover one side we will automatically expand in the other
direction as well to cover the other side.

Let's take a look at another example.

---

**Example 2** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = \sqrt[3]{x}$ $x = 8$ and the $x$-axis about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

First let's get a graph of the bounded region and the solid.

![image 6.4_5](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image007.gif)

![image 6.4_6](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image008.gif)

Okay, we are rotating about a horizontal axis. This means that the area will be
a function of $y$ and so our equation will also need to be written in $x = f(y)$
form.

$$ y = \sqrt[3]{x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y^3 $$

As we did in the ring/disk section let's take a couple of looks at a typical
cylinder. The sketch on the left shows a typical cylinder with the back half of
the object also in the sketch to give the right sketch some context. The sketch
on the right contains a typical cylinder and only the curves that define the
edge of the solid.

![image 6.4_7](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image009.gif)

![image 6.4_8](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image010.gif)

In this case the width of the cylinder is not the function value as it was in
the previous example. In this case the function value is the distance between
the edge of the cylinder and the $y$-axis. The distance from the edge out to the
line is $x = 8$ and so the width is then $8 - y^3$. The cross-sectional area in
this case is,

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{width}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(y)\left(8 - y^3\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(8y - y^4\right) $$

The first cylinder will cut into the solid at $y = 0$ and the final cylinder
will cut in at $y = 2$ and so these are our limits of integration.

The volume of this solid is,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \int_{0}^{2}{8y - y^4\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(4y^2 - \frac{1}{5}y^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{96\pi}{5} $$

---

The remaining examples in this section will have axis of rotation about axis
other than the $x$ and $y$-axis. As with the method of rings/disks we will need
to be a little careful with these.

---

**Example 3** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $y = 2\sqrt{x - 1}$ and $y = x - 1$ about the line $x = 6$.

**Solution**

Here's a graph of the bounded region and solid.

![image 6.4_9](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image011.gif)

![image 6.4_10](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image012.gif)

Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder. Again, the sketch on the left is
here to provide some context for the sketch on the right.

![image 6.4_11](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image013.gif)

![image 6.4_12](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image014.gif)

Okay, there is a lot going on in the sketch to the left. First notice that the
radius is not just an $x$ or $y$ as it was in the previous two cases. In this
case $x$ is the distance from the $y$-axis to the edge of the cylinder and we
need the distance from the axis of rotation to the edge of the cylinder. That
means that the radius of this cylinder is $6 - x$.

Secondly, the height of the cylinder is the difference of the two functions in
this case.

The cross-sectional area is then,

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{height}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(6 - x)\left(2\sqrt{x - 1} - x + 1\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(x^2 - 7x + 6 + 12\sqrt{x - 1} - 2x\sqrt{x - 1}\right) $$

Now the first cylinder will cut into the solid at $x = 1$ and the first cylinder
will cut into the solid at $x = 5$ so there are our limits.

Here is the volume.

$$ V = \int_{a}^{b}{A(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{5}{x^2 - 7x + 6 + 12\sqrt{x - 1} - 2x\sqrt{x - 1}\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{7}{2}x^2 + 6x + 8(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{4}{3}(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{4}{5}(x - 1)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(\frac{136}{15}\right) $$

$$ \quad = \frac{272\pi}{15} $$

The integration of the last term is a little tricky so let's do that here. It
will use the substitution,

$$ u = x - 1 \quad du = dx \quad x = u + 1 $$

$$ \int{2x\sqrt{x - 1}\, dx} = 2\int{(u + 1)u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ \quad = 2\int{u^{\frac{3}{2}} + u^{\frac{1}{2}}\, du} $$

$$ \quad = 2\left(\frac{2}{5}u^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{2}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}}\right) + c $$

$$ \quad = \frac{4}{5}(x - 1)^{\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{4}{3}(x - 1)^{\frac{3}{2}} + c $$

We saw one of these kinds of substitutions back in the
[**substitution**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/SubstitutionRuleIndefinitePtII.aspx#Int_SubInd_II_Ex4)
section.

**Example 4** Determine the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region
bounded by $x = (y - 2)^2$ and $y = x$ about the line $y = -1$.

**Solution**

We should first get the intersection points there.

$$ y = (y - 2)^2 $$

$$ y = y^2 - 4y + 4 $$

$$ 0 = y^2 - 5y + 4 $$

$$ 0 = (y - 4)(y - 1) $$

So, the two curves will intersect at $y = 1$ and $y = 4$. Here is a sketch of
the bounded region and the solid.

![image 6.4_13](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image015.gif)

![image 6.4_14](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image016.gif)

Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder. The sketch on the left is here to
provide some context for the sketch on the right.

![image 6.4_15](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image017.gif)

![image 6.4_16](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/VolumeWIthCylinder_Files/image018.gif)

Here's the cross-sectional area for this cylinder.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(\text{radius})(\text{width}) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi(y + 1)\left(y - (y - 2)^2\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\left(-y^3 + 4y^2 + y - 4\right) $$

The first cylinder will cut into the solid at $y = 1$ and the final cylinder
will cut in at $y = 4$. The volume is then,

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{A(y)\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi\int_{1}^{4}{-y^3 + 4y^2 + y - 4\, dy} $$

$$ \quad = 2\pi \left. \left(-\frac{1}{4}y^4 + \frac{4}{3}y^3 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 - 4y\right) \right|_{1}^{4} $$

$$ \quad = \frac{63\pi}{2} $$

## Practice Problems

For each of the following problems use the method of cylinders to determine the
volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the given curves
about the given axis.

**1.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = (y - 2)^2$, the $x$-axis and the
$y$-axis about the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, unlike the method of rings, we must
have our functions in the form of $f(y)$, which they are in this case, no
adjustment is necessary of our given functions.

Because we are rotating about the $x$-axis, our formula for the area of the
cylinder will be this:

$$ A = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

We'll also need our limits of integration.

Because we are simply rotating around a major axis, we can ascertain that our
radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width of the cylinder in this case is the distance from the $y$-axis to the
last point of intersection of the cylinder to the given function. In other
words, it simply is the function:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)(y - 2)^2 $$

Let's simply distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(y^2 - 4y + 4\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(y^3 - 4y^2 + 4y\right) $$

To find the limits of integration, find where the first ring of the cylinder
intersects with the function and the last ring of the cylinder that intersects
with the function. From the graph we can see that this occurs at $y =0$ and
$y = 2$ respectively. So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 2 $$

We can now setup our Volume Formula:

$$ V = \int_{c}^{d}{f(y)\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{y^3 - 4y^2 + 4y\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{4}y^4 - \frac{4}{3}y^3 + 2y^2\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - \frac{4}{3}(2)^3 + 2(2)^2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - \frac{4}{3}(0)^3 + 2(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(4 - \frac{32}{3} + 8\right) $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{8}{3}\pi} $$

**2.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = \dfrac{1}{x}$, $x = \dfrac{1}{2}$,
$x = 4$ and the $x$-axis about the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $y$-axis, so functions must be in terms of $f(x)$,
which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around the $y$-axis, our Area function for our cylinder
will be in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The radius, since we are simply rotating around a major axis is $x$.

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is simply the given function:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\frac{x}{x}\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi $$

Now find the limits of integration. In this case they are given to us as the
first cylinder intersects our function at $x = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and the second
cylinder intersects our function at $x = 4$:

$$ \frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 4 $$

Now find the Volume:

$$ V = \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{4}{2\pi\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. (x) \right|_{\frac{1}{2}}^{4} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[(4) - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)  $$

$$ V = \pi\left(\frac{14}{2}\right)  $$

$$ \boxed{V = 7\pi} $$

**3.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 4x$ and $y = x^3$ about the $y$-axis.
For this problem assume that $x \geq 0$.

**Solution**

We are rotating around the $y$-axis, so the given functions must be in terms of
$f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust them.

Since we are rotating around the $y$-axis, the Area of Cylinder Function must be
in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

The radius is simply $x$, the height requires some thinking to find. The height
of base of our cylinder is defined by $x^3$ from the $x$-axis while the top of
our cylinder is defined by $4x$, thusly our height is the difference between
these two.

Note we omit the $\pm$ because the problem statement tells us that $x \geq 0$.
This leaves us with our area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(4x - x^3\right) $$

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(4x^2 - x^4\right) $$

Our limits of integration are also bounded by where the first cylinder
intersects, note that our above two functions meet at $x = 0$. So our limits of
integration are:

$$ 4x = x^3 $$

$$ 4 = x^2 $$

$$ 2 = x $$

We omit the $\pm$ as the problem statement tells us that $x \geq 0$.

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

Now we find the volume.

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{4x^2 - x^4\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{4}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{5}x^5\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{4}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{5}(2)^5\right) - \left(\frac{4}{3}(0)^3 - \frac{1}{5}(0)^5\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{32}{3} - \frac{32}{5}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{64}{15}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{128}{15}\pi} $$

**4.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 4x$ and $y = x^3$ about the $x$-axis.
For this problem assume that $x \geq 0$.

**Solution**

We are now rotating about the $x$-axis for the same set of functions given to us
in problem 3. This means however that we'll have to adjust our given functions
so that they are in terms of $f(y)$.

$$ y = 4x $$

$$ x = \frac{1}{4}y $$

$$ y = x^3 $$

$$ x = \sqrt[3]{y} = y^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

Our area function is therefore an expression of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Our radius is simply $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

And our width is the difference between our two functions, but the order is
reversed because $x = y^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is the second most outermost ring of the
cylinder.

$$ \text{width} = y^{\frac{1}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y $$

Our area is therefore:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(y^{\frac{1}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(y^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y^2\right) $$

Our limits of integration again can be found by finding the intersection points
of our two graphs, one of which is obviously $0$ by looking at the graph. The
other is determined by where they intersect.

$$ 4x = x^3 $$

$$ 4 = x^2 $$

$$ 2 = x $$

But this time we need the $y$-coordinate, let's plug it into either given
function and we'll find it:

$$ 4(2) = 8 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Thusly we can find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{8}{y^{\frac{4}{3}} - \frac{1}{4}y^2\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(\frac{3}{7}y^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}y^3\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}(8)^3\right) - \left(\frac{3}{7}(0)^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}(0)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(\frac{3}{7}(8)^{\frac{7}{3}} - \frac{1}{12}(8)^3\right)\right] $$

(3/7)(8)^(7/3) - (1/12)(8)^3

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{256}{21}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512}{21}\pi} $$

**5.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x + 1$, $y = 3$ and $x = 4$ about the
line $y = 10$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our functions must be in terms
of $f(y)$, they must be adjusted.

$$ y = 2x + 1 $$

$$ 2x = y - 1 $$

$$ x = \frac{1}{2}(y - 1) $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of width.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis that is above the major
$x$-axis, the radius must be adjusted from simply being $y$ to the value of the
minor $x$-axis minus $y$:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

The width must also be adjusted, but has nothing to do with the axis of
rotation.

In this case we take the outermost ring of the cylinder, $x = 4$ and subtract it
from our given function in terms of $f(y)$ that we converted earlier:

$$ \text{width} = 4 - \left[\frac{1}{2}(y - 1)\right] $$

$$ \text{width} = \frac{8}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y + \frac{1}{2} $$

$$ \text{width} = \frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y $$

Our area function therefore becomes:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(\frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y\right) $$

Now distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(10 - y)\left(\frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2}y\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\frac{1}{2}y^2 - \frac{19}{2}y + 45\right) $$

Our limits of integration are given to us, but one of them needs to be
converted. The first cylinder base ring is simply $y = 3$, the other limit is
given as $x = 4$, which we'll have to plug into our given function to find the
outermost $y$ value:

$$ y = 2(4) + 1 = 9 $$

So our limits of integration are:

$$ 3 \leq y \leq 9 $$

We can now find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{3}^{9}{\frac{1}{2}y^2 - \frac{19}{2}y + 45\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{6}y^3 - \frac{19}{4}y^2 + 45y\right) \right|_{3}^{9} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{6}(9)^3 - \frac{19}{4}(9)^2 + 45(9)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{6}(3)^3 - \frac{19}{4}(3)^2 + 45(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(45) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 90\pi} $$

**6.** Rotate the region bounded by $x = y^2 - 4$ and $x = 6 - 3y$ about the
line $y = -8$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, we must have our functions in
terms of $f(y)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around a minor $x$-axis, our area function must be in
terms of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

If the axis of rotation was simply the $x$-axis, then the radius would just be
$y$, but in this case our axis of rotation is a negative minor $x$-axis. Thusly
we _add_ $y$ to the _absolute value_ of the axis value to get our radius:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(|-8| + y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(8 + y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Had our first bounding function simply been the $y$-axis, we could say that the
width was $x = 6 - 3y$, but we must actually subtract the first bounding
function by the second to get our width:

$$ \text{width } = 6 - 3y - \left(y^2 - 4\right) $$

$$ \text{width } = 6 - 3y - y^2 + 4 $$

$$ \text{width } = 10 - 3y - y^2 $$

This gives us the Area of:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(8 + y)\left(10 - 3y - y^2\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(8 + y)\left(10 - 3y - y^2\right) $$

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(80 - y^3 - 11y^2 - 14y\right) $$

Our limits of integration can be ound by where our two given functions
intersect.

$$ y^2 - 4 = 6 - 3y $$

$$ y^2 + 3y - 10 = 0 $$

$$ (y + 5)(y - 2) = 0 $$

Our limits of integration therefore are:

$$ -5 \leq y \leq 2 $$

And now we find our volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-5}^{2}{80 - y^3 - 11y^2 - 14y\, dy} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(80y - \frac{1}{4}y^4 - \frac{11}{3}y^3 - 7y^2\right) \right|_{-5}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(80(2) - \frac{1}{4}(2)^4 - \frac{11}{3}(2)^3 - 7(2)^2\right) - \left(80(-5) - \frac{1}{4}(-5)^4 - \frac{11}{3}(-5)^3 - 7(-5)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{4459}{12}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{4459}{6}\pi} $$

**7.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = x^2 - 6x + 9$ and $y = -x^2 + 6x - 1$
about the line $x = 8$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, the given functions must be in
terms of $f(x)$, which they are, no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, the area must be expressed in
terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

If the axis of rotation was simply the $y$-axis, then the radius would simply be
$x$, but since that is not the case, we subtract $x$ from $x = 8$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(8 - x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

To find the height we subtract one function from the other. Looking at the
graph, we can see that within the boudning regions, the top or outer most
function is $y = -x^2 + 6x - 1$, and the lower function is $x^2 - 6x + 9$,
taking the difference will yield:

$$ \text{height} = -x^2 + 6x - 1 - \left(x^2 - 6x + 9\right) $$

$$ \text{height} = -x^2 + 6x - 1 - x^2 + 6x - 9 $$

$$ \text{height} = -2x^2 + 12x - 10 $$

This gives us our area formula:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(8 - x)\left(-2x^2 + 12x - 10\right) $$

Distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(2x^3 - 28x^2 + 106x - 80\right) $$

To find the limits of integration, set the two given functions equal to one
another to find the points:

$$ x^2 - 6x + 9 = -x^2 + 6x - 1 $$

$$ 2x^2 - 12x + 10 = 0 $$

$$ 2\left(x^2 - 6x + 5\right) = 0 $$

$$ 2(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 $$

Thusly our limits of integration are:

$$ 1 \leq x \leq 5 $$

Our volume is therefore:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{1}^{5}{2x^3 - 28x^2 + 106x - 80\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - \frac{28}{3}x^3 + 53x^2 - 80x\right) \right|_{1}^{5} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}(5)^4 - \frac{28}{3}(5)^3 + 53(5)^2 - 80(5)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}(1)^4 - \frac{28}{3}(1)^3 + 53(1)^2 - 80(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left(\frac{320}{3}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{640}{3}\pi} $$

**8.** Rotate the region bounded by
$y = \dfrac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}$, $y = 5 - \dfrac{1}{4}x$,
$x = -1$ and $x = 6$ about the line $x = -2$.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our functions must be in terms
of $f(x)$, which they are, so there's no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating around a minor $y$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our radius is expressed in terms of the absolute value of the negative
rotational axis value plus $x$:

$$ \text{radius} = |-2| + x $$

$$ \text{radius} = 2 + x $$

Our Area formula thus far therefore is:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 + x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Our height is simply the top function minus the bottom function. From the graph
we can see that the top function is $y = 5 - \dfrac{1}{4}x$, and that the bottom
function is $y = \dfrac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}$.

$$ \text{height } = 5 - \frac{1}{4}x - \left(\frac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}\right) $$

Our area formula becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(2 + x)\left(5 - \frac{1}{4}x - \frac{\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}}{x + 2}\right) $$

10 + 5x - (1/2)x - (1/4)(x^2)

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(10 + \frac{9}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}x^2 - \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x} \right) $$

In this case, the limits of our integration are given to us since both constant
boundaries are given in terms of $x$:

$$ -1 \leq x \leq 6 $$

The volume therefore is:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{-1}^{6}{10 + \frac{9}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}x^2 - \mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left. \left(10x + \frac{9}{4}x^2 - \frac{1}{12}x^3 - 2\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}x}\right) \right|_{-1}^{6} $$

$$ V = 2\pi\left[\left(10(6) + \frac{9}{4}(6)^2 - \frac{1}{12}(6)^3 - 2\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}(6)}\right) - \left(10(-1) + \frac{9}{4}(-1)^2 - \frac{1}{12}(-1)^3 - 2\mathbf{e}^{\frac{1}{2}(-1)}\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{V = 2\pi\left[\frac{392}{3} - 2\mathbf{e}^3 + 2\mathbf{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right]} $$

## Assignment Problems

For problems 1 - 14 use the method cylinders to determine the volume of the
solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the given curves about the
given axis.

**1.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $y = 8$ and the $y$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, the given functions must be
expressed in terms of $f(x)$, which they are, so no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the $y$-axis, the Area function must be expressed
in terms of height:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around a major $y$-axis, the radius is quite simply $x$.
Our area function therefore becomes:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Looking at the graph, we can easily see that the "top" of our cylinder is capped
off by the given bounding function of $y = 8$, and that our "bottom" is capped
off by the given bounding funciton of $y = 2x^2$, thusly our height is simply
the difference of the "top" minus the "bottom". This causes our final Area
function to become:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(8 - 2x^2\right) $$

And simply distribute:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(8x - 2x^3\right) $$

The limits of integration can be found in this case by looking at our graph and
seeing that the first "slice" of our cylinder occurs at $x = 0$. The last slice
occurs where the two given boundary functions intersect:

$$ 2x^2 = 8 $$

$$ x^2 = 4 $$

$$ x = \pm 2 $$

Because we are bounded by the major $y$-axis, we can omit the $\pm$ in this case
because only the region of $x \geq 0$ is relevant. This leaves our limits of
integration as:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

We can now find our Volume:

$$ V = 2\pi\int_{0}^{2}{8x - 2x^3\, dx} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left. \left(4x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^4\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(4(2)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(2)^4\right) - \left(4(0)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(0)^4\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi \left[\left(16 - 8\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 2\pi(8) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 16\pi} $$

**2.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $y = 8$ and the $y$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

This is pretty much the same as problem 1, except we're now rotating around the
$x$-axis, which means that our given boundary functions must be given in terms
of $f(y)$. This means that one of our boundary functions need to be adjusted:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = x^2 $$

$$ x = \left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

Because we are rotating around the major $x$-axis, this means that our Area
funciton must be in terms of _width_:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

In similar thinking to problem 1, because we are rotating around a major
$x$-axis, the radius is simply $y$. This leaves our area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

In this case now, the width of the cylinder is simply the given boundary
function, adjusted of course for the new expression. This leaves our Area
function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

And simplify:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)y^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ A(y) = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}y^{\frac{3}{2}} $$

Let's now find our limits of integration.

By looking at the graph, we can see that the inner "disk" of the cylinder occurs
at $y = 0$. The outer "disk" occurs simply at the given $y = 8$. Thusly our
limits of integration are:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

Our volume formula is therefore:

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{0}^{8}{y^{\frac{3}{2}}\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}} \left. \left(\frac{2}{5}y^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{256\sqrt{2}}{5}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi(256)}{5} $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512\pi}{5}} $$

**3.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $x = 2$ and the $x$-axis about
the $x$-axis.

**Solution**

This is extremely similar to problem 2, but let's take it slow to be sure.

Because we are rotating around the $x$-axis, our given boundary functions must
be expressed in terms of $f(y)$. Let's adjust:

$$ y = 2x^2 $$

$$ \frac{1}{2}y = x^2 $$

$$ x = \left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

Like problem 2, we are rotating around the $x$-axis, which means our Area
formula must be expressed in terms of width:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

By the same reasoning as problem 2, since we are rotating around the major
$x$-axis, our radius is simply $y$.

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\text{width}\right) $$

Similarly again to problem 2, our width is simply the second given boundary
function adjusted as done earlier. This leaves our area function as:

$$ A(y) = 2\pi(y)\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$

We can simplify this as before as:

$$ A(y) = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}y^{\frac{3}{2}} $$

The limits of integration actually are the same as problem 2 as well, but we
determine them in a different way. The first "disk" is the same as problem 2,
that of $y = 0$. For the second limit, because we are given a new additional
bounding region of $x = 2$, we can plug that into our other bounding function
and solve to find it:

$$ y = 2(2)^2 = 8 $$

Leaving our limits of integration as:

$$ 0 \leq y \leq 8 $$

And this leaves our Volume formula the same as problem 2, so no need to do
anything different here:

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{0}^{8}{y^{\frac{3}{2}}\, dy} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}} \left. \left(\frac{2}{5}y^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) \right|_{0}^{8} $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{5}(0)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\right] $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{2}{5}(8)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{256\sqrt{2}}{5}\right) $$

$$ V = \frac{2\pi(256)}{5} $$

$$ \boxed{V = \frac{512\pi}{5}} $$

**4.** Rotate the region bounded by $y = 2x^2$, $x = 2$ and the $x$-axis about
the $y$-axis.

**Solution**

And funny enough this is similar to problem 1, but let's go slow to be sure.

We are rotating about the $y$-axis, so thusly our functions must be expressed as
$f(x)$, which they are, so no need to adjust.

Because we are rotating about the major $y$-axis, our Area function must be
expressed in terms of _height_:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi\left(\text{radius}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Because we are rotating around a major $y$-axis, our radius is simply $x$:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

Ah, this is where we deviate from problem 1! If we look at our graph, we can see
that our "top" cap of the cylinder is $y = 2x^2$, and our "bottom" cap of the
cylinder is $y = 0$ (the $x$-axis). The height is the difference between these
two. This leaves the Area function as:

$$ A(x) = 2\pi(x)\left(2x^2\right) $$

Simplifying the area gives us:

$$ A(x) = 4\pi x^3 $$

Let's find the limits of integration.

We can see that the bottom disk of our cylinder is simply at $x = 0$, and our
other limit is given to us in the boundary function of $x = 2$. This leaves our
limits of integration as:

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2 $$

We can now find our Volume:

$$ V = 4\pi\int_{0}^{2}{x^3\, dx} $$

$$ V = 4\pi \left. \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4\right) \right|_{0}^{2} $$

$$ V = 4\pi \left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(2)^4\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(0)^4\right)\right] $$

$$ V = 4\pi(4) $$

$$ \boxed{V = 16\pi} $$
