# Section 6.6 : Work

This is the final application of integral that we'll be looking at in this
course. In this section we will be looking at the amount of work that is done by
a force in moving an object.

In a first course in Physics you typically look at the work that a constant
force, $F$, does when moving an object over a distance of $d$. In these cases
the work is,

$$ W = Fd $$

However, most forces are not constant and will depend upon where exactly the
force is acting. So, let's suppose that the force at any $x$ is given by $F(x)$.
Then the work done by the force in moving an object from $x = a$ to $x = b$ is
given by,

$$ W = \int_{a}^{b}{F(x)\, dx} $$

To see a justification of this formula see the
[**Proof of Various Integral
Properties**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ProofIntProp.aspx#Extras_IntPf_Work)
section of the Extras chapter.

Notice that if the force is constant we get the correct formula for a constant
force.

$$ W = \int_{a}^{b}{F(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. Fx \right|_{a}^{b} $$

$$ \quad = F(b - a) $$

where $b - a$ is simply the distance moved, or $d$.

So, let's take a look at a couple of examples of non-constant forces.

---

**Example 1** A spring has a natural length of 20 cm. A 40 N force is required
to stretch (and hold the spring) to a length of 30 cm. How much work is done in
stretching the spring from 35 cm to 38 cm?

**Solution**

This example will require Hooke's Law to determine the force. Hooke's Law tells
us that the force required to stretch a spring a distance of $x$ meters from its
natural length is,

$$ F(x) = kx $$

where $k > 0$ is called the spring constant. It is important to remember that
the $x$ in this formula is the distance the spring is stretched from its natural
length and not the actual length of the spring.

So, the first thing that we need to do is determine the spring constant for this
spring. We can do that using the initial information. A force of 40 N is
required to stretch the spring

$$ 30\text{cm} - 20\text{cm} = 10\text{cm} = 0.1\text{m} $$

from its natural length. Using Hooke's Law we have,

$$ 40 = 0.10k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 400 $$

So, according to Hooke's Law the force required to hold this spring $x$ meters
from its natural length is,

$$ F(x) = 400x $$

We want to know the work required to stretch the spring from 35cm to 38cm.
First, we need to convert these into distances from the natural length in
meters. Doing that gives us $x$'s of 0.15m and 0.18m.

The work is then,

$$ W = \int_{0.15}^{0.18}{400x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. 200x^2 \right|_{0.15}^{0.18} $$

$$ \quad = 1.98\text{J} $$

**Example 2** We have a cable that weighs 2 lbs/ft attached to a bucket filled
with coal that weighs 800 lbs. The bucket is initially at the bottom of a 500 ft
mine shaft. Answer each of the following about this.

**(a)** Determine the amount of work required to lift the bucket to the midpoint
of the shaft.

**(b)** Determine the amount of work required to lift the bucket from the
midpoint of the shaft to the top of the shaft.

**\(c\)** Determine the amount of work required to lift the bucket all the way
up the shaft.

**Discussion**

Before answering either part we first need to determine the force. In this case
the force will be the weight of the bucket and cable at any point in the shaft.

To determine a formula for this we will first need to set a convention for $x$.
For this problem we will set $x$ to be the amount of cable that has been pulled
up. So at the bottom of the shaft $x = 0$, at the midpoint of the shaft
$x = 250$ and at the top of the shaft $x = 500$. Also, at any point in the shaft
there is $500 - x$ feet of cable still in the shaft.

The force then for any $x$ is then nothing more than the weight of the cable and
bucket at that point. This is,

$$ F(x) = \text{weight of cable } + \text{weight of bucket}/\text{coal} $$

$$ \quad = 2(500 - x) + 800 $$

$$ \quad = 1800 - 2x $$

We can now answer the questions.

**Solution**

**(a)** Determine the amount of work required to lift the bucket to the midpoint
of the shaft.

In this case we want to know the work required to move the cable and bucket/coal
from $x = 0$ to $x = 250$. The work required is,

$$ W = \int_{0}^{250}{F(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \int_{0}^{250}{1800 - 2x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \left(1800x - x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{250} $$

$$ \quad = 287500 \text{ ft - lb} $$

**(b)** Determine the amount of work required to lift the bucket from the
midpoint of the shaft to the top of the shaft.

In this case we want to move the cable and bucket/coal from $x = 250$ to
$x = 500$. The work required is,

$$ W = \int_{250}^{500}{F(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \int_{250}^{500}{1800 - 2x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \left(1800 - x^2\right) \right|_{250}^{500} $$

$$ \quad = 262500\text{ ft - lb} $$

**\(c\)** Determine the amount of work required to lift the bucket all the way
up the shaft.

In this case the work is,

$$ W = \int_{0}^{500}{F(x)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \int_{0}^{500}{1800 - 2x\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \left(1800 - x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{500} $$

$$ \quad = 650000\text{ ft - lb} $$

Note that we could have instead just added the results from the first two parts
and we would have gotten the same answer to the third part.

**Example 3** A 20 ft cable weighs 80 lbs and hangs from the ceiling of a
building without touching the floor. Determine the work that must be done to
lift the bottom end of the chain all the way up until it touches the ceiling.

**Solution**

First, we need to determine the weight per foot of the cable. This is easy
enough to get,

$$ \frac{80\text{ lbs}}{20\text{ ft}} = 4\text{ lb}/\text{ft} $$

Next, let $x$ be the distance from the ceiling to any point on the cable. Using
this convention we can see that the portion of the cable in the range
$10 < x \leq 20$ will actually be lifted. The portion of the cable in the range
$0 \leq x \leq 10$ will not be lifted at all since once the bottom of the cable
has been lifted up to the ceiling the cable will be doubled up and each portion
will have a length of 10 ft. So, the upper 10 foot portion of the cable will
never be lifted while the lower 10 ft portion will be lifted.

Now, the very bottom of the cable, $x = 20$, will be lifted 10 feet to get to
the midpoint and then a further 10 feet to get to the ceiling. A point 2 feet
from the bottom of the cable, $x = 18$ will lift 8 feet to get to the midpoint
and then a further 8 feet until it reaches its final position (if it is 2 feet
from the bottom then its final position will be 2 feet from the ceiling).
Continuing on in this fashion we can see that for any point on the lower half of
the cable, _i.e._ $10 \leq x \leq 20$ it will be lifted a tottal of $2(x - 10)$.

As with the previous example the force required to lift any point of the cable
in this range is simply the distance that point will be lifted times the
weight/foot of the cable. So, the force is then,

$$ F(x) = \left(\text{distance lifted}\right)\left(\text{weight per foot of cable}\right) $$

$$ \quad = 2(x - 10)(4) $$

$$ \quad = 8(x - 10) $$

The work required is now,

$$ W = \int_{10}^{20}{8(x - 10)\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = \left. \left(4x^2 - 80x\right) \right|_{10}^{20} $$

$$ \quad = 400\text{ ft - lb} $$

---

Provided we can find the force, $F(x)$, for a given problem then using the above
method for determining the work is (generally) pretty simple. However, there are
some problems where this approach won’t easily work. Let's take a look at one of
those kinds of problems.

---

**Example 4** A tank in the shape of an inverted cone has a height of 15 meters
and a base radius of 4 meters and is filled with water to a depth of 12 meters.
Determine the amount of work needed to pump all of the water to the top of the
tank. Assume that the density of the water is 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.

**Solution**

Okay, in this case we cannot just determine a force function, $F(x)$ that will
work for us. So, we are going to need to approach this from a different
standpoint.

Let’s first set $x = 0$ to be the lower end of the tank/cone and $x = 15$ to be
the top of the tank/cone. With this definition of our $x$'s we can now see that
the water in the tank will correspond to the interval $[0, 12]$.

So, let's start off by dividing $[0, 12]$ into $n$ subintervals each of width
$\Delta x$ and let's also let $x_i^*$ be any point from the $i$<sup>th</sup>
subinterval where $i = 1, 2, \dots n$. Now, for each subinterval we will
approximate the water in the tank corresponding to that interval as a cylinder
of radius $r_i$ and height $\Delta x$.

Here is a quick sketch of the tank. Note that the sketch really isn't to scale
and we are looking at the tank from directly in front so we can see all the
various quantities that we need to work with.

![image 6.6_1](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Work_Files/image001.gif)

The red strip in the sketch represents the "cylinder" of water in the
$i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval. A quick application of similar triangles will
allow us to relate $r_i$ to $x_i^*$ (which we'll need in a bit) as follows.

$$ \frac{r_i}{x_i^*} = \frac{4}{15} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_i = \frac{4}{15}x_i^* $$

Okay, the mass, $m_i$, of the volume of water, $V_i$, for the $i$<sup>th</sup>
subinterval is simply,

$$ m_i = \text{density} \times V_i $$

We know the density of the water (it was given in the problem statement) and
because we are approximating the water in the $i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval as a
cylinder we can easily approximate the volume as,

$$ V_i \approx \pi\left(\text{radius}\right)^2\left(\text{height}\right) $$

We can now approximate the mass of water in the $i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval,

$$ m_i = (1000)\left[\pi r_i^2\Delta x\right] = 1000\pi\left(\frac{4}{15}x_i^*\right)^2\Delta x = \frac{640}{9}\pi\left(x_i^*\right)^2\Delta x $$

To raise this volume of water we need to overcome the force of gravity that is
acting on the volume and that is, $F = m_ig$, where
$g = 9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2$ is the gravitational acceleration. The <F4>orce 5o
raise the volume of water 8n the $i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval is then
approximately,

$$ F_i = m_ig \approx (9.8)\frac{640}{9}\pi\left(x_i^*\right)^2\Delta x $$

Next, in order to reach to the top of the tank the water in the $i$<sup>th</sup>
subinterval will need to travel approximately $15 - x_i^*$ to reach the top of
the tank. Because the volume of the water in the $i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval is
constant the force needed to raise the water through any distance is also a
constant force.

Therefore, the work to move the volume of water in the $i$<sup>th</sup>
subinterval to the top of the tank, _i.e_ raise it a distance of $15 - x_i^*$,
is then approximately,

$$ W_i \approx F_i\left(15 - x_i^*\right) = (9.8)\frac{640}{9}\pi\left(x_i^*\right)^2\left(15 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x $$

The total amount of work required to raise all the water to the top of the tank
is then approximately the sum of each of the $W_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots n$. Or,

$$ W \approx \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(9.8)}\frac{640}{9}\pi\left(x_i^*\right)^2\left(15 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x $$

To get the actual amount of work we simply need to take $n \to \infty$. _I.e._
compute the following limit,

$$ W = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(9.8)}\frac{640}{9}\pi\left(x_i^*\right)^2\left(15 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x $$

This limit of a summation should look somewhat familiar to you. It's probably
been some time, but recalling the
[**definition of the definite integral**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DefnofDefiniteIntegral.aspx)
we can see that this is nothing more than the following definite integral.

$$ W = \int_{0}^{12}{(9.8)\frac{640}{9}\pi x^2(15 - x)\, dx} = (9.8)\frac{640}{9}\pi\int_{0}^{12}{15x^2 - x^3\, dx} $$

$$ \quad = (9.8)\frac{640}{9}\pi \left. \left(5x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4\right) \right|_{0}^{12} = 7,566,362.543 \text{ J} $$

---

As we've seen in the previous example we sometimes need to compute "incremental"
work and then use that to determine the actual integral we need to compute. This
idea does arise on occassion and we shouldn't forget it!

## Practice Problems

**1.** A force of $F(x) = x^2 - \cos(3x) + 2$, $x$ is in meters, acts on an
object. What is the work required to move the object from $x = 3$ to $x = 7$?

**Solution**

We don't have to worry about converting the given units in order to apply
Newton's Formula here. We are given everything we need to simply plug and play.

$$ W = \int_{3}^{7}{x^2 - \cos(3x) + 2\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{3}\sin(3x) + 2x\right) \right|_{3}^{7} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(\frac{1}{3}(7)^3 - \frac{1}{3}\sin(3(7)) + 2(7)\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}(3)^3 - \frac{1}{3}\sin(3(3)) + 2(3)\right)\right] $$

$$ W = \left[\left(\frac{343}{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sin(21) + 14\right) - \left(9 - \frac{1}{3}\sin(9) + 6\right)\right] $$

$$ W = \left[\frac{343}{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sin(21) + 14 - 9 + \frac{1}{3}\sin(9) - 6\right] $$

$$ W = \left[\frac{343}{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sin(21) + \frac{1}{3}\sin(9) - 1\right] $$

$$ W = \left[\frac{340}{3} -\frac{1}{3}\sin(21) + \frac{1}{3}\sin(9)\right] $$

$$ W = \frac{1}{3}\left[340- \sin(21) + \sin(9)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{W \approx 113.1918 \text{ J}} $$

**2.** A spring has a natural length of 18 inches and a force of 20 lbs is
required to stretch and hold the spring to a length of 24 inches. What is the
work required to stretch the spring from a length of 21 inches to a length of 26
inches?

**Solution**

Much like Example 1, we'll need to use Hooke's Law here:

$$ F(x) = kx $$

Where $k > 0$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the distance the spring is
stretched from its natural length.

The force, $F(x)$ is given to us as 20 lbs, and $x$ is the distance the spring
is stretched from its natural length, so $x = 24 - 18 = 6 \text{ in}$. We'll
need the displacement in feet, since we're using US metrics and Force is
typically measured in feet times lbs, not inches times lbs.

$$ 6\text{ in} = \frac{6\text{ in}}{12 \text{ in/ft}} = 0.5\text{ ft} $$

This leaves us with Hooke's formula filled in and we can solve for the spring
constant, $k$:

$$ 20 = 0.5k $$

$$ k = 40 $$

This leaves us with the Force formula as:

$$ F(x) = 40x $$

The limits of integration require us to determine $x^i_*$ at both given
extremities, or the "amount of stretch" at each point from the natural length of
the spring. We are given the two points of 21 inches and 26 inches, so we'll
need to find the difference between each stretched distance and the natural
length of the spring:

$$ 26 - 18 = 8 \text{ in} $$

$$ 21 - 18 = 3 \text{ in} $$

And convert them to feet for the aforementioned reason:

$$ \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ ft} $$

$$ \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ ft} $$

And now we can find our Work:

$$ W = \int_{\frac{1}{4}}^{\frac{2}{3}}{40x\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(20x^2\right) \right|_{\frac{1}{4}}^{\frac{2}{3}} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(20\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2\right) - \left(20\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ W = \frac{275}{36} \approx 7.6389 \text{ ft - lbs} $$

**3.** A cable with mass 1/2 kg/meter is lifting a load of 150 kg that is
initially at the bottom of a 50 meter shaft. How much work is required to lift
the load 1/4 of the way up the shaft?

**Solution**

We'll need to establish a convention for $x$. We'll make $x$ to be the amount of
cable that has to be puled up. Thusly at any point $x$, the length of the cable
will be $50 - x$.

$$ \frac{1}{2}(50 - x) + 150 $$

$$ 25 - \frac{1}{2}x + 150 $$

$$ 175 - \frac{1}{2}x $$

We know that the force required to hold the chain and load at any point is just
the weight of the chain and load at any point, and we also know thank's to
Newton's Formula of acceleration that weight is simply:

$$ \text{Weight} = \text{ mass} \times 9.8 $$

Therefore our Force is:

$$ F(x) = 9.8\left(175 - \frac{1}{2}x\right) $$

$$ F(x) = 1715 - 4.9x $$

Our limits are easy enough to reason about, it's simply the distance that we
start at $x = 0$, one fourth of the way up the chain or
$x = \dfrac{50}{4} = 12.5$. Let's find our Work:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{12.5}{1715 - 4.9x\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(1715x - 2.45x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{12.5} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(1715(12.5) - 2.45(12.5)^2\right) - \left(1715(0) - 2.45(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ W = 1715(12.5) - 2.45(12.5)^2 $$

$$ \boxed{W = 21054.6875 \text{ J}} $$

**4.** A tank of water is 15 feet long and has a cross section in the shape of
an equilateral triangle with sides 2 feet long (point of the triangle points
directly down). The tank is filled with water to a depth of 9 inches. Determine
the amount of work needed to pump all of the 2ater to the top of the tank.
Assume the density of the water is 62 lbs/ft<sup>3</sup>.

**Solution**

Firstly, let $x = 0$ be the bottom fo the tank, and
$x = \dfrac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}$ feet be the height of the water. This means
we'll be working within the interval of $\left[0, \dfrac{3}{4}\right]$.

We divide this interval into $n$ subintervals each of width $\Delta x$, and
we'll let $x_i^*$ be any point in the $i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval where
$n = 1, 2, \dots , n$. Additionally, we'll let $s_i$ be the length of the sides
of the triangle at any given point along these intervals.

If we divide the equilateral triangle in half, we get two right trangles. This
means we have two triangles with the angles $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$, $\dfrac{\pi}{6}$,
and $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$. Each triangle has an unknown height, $h$, and one side
that is $1$ (because we divided the equialateral triangle in half), and a
hypotenuse of $2$. We can therefore use right angle trigonometry to find our
height:

$$ \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{h}{2} $$

$$ h = 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \sqrt{3} $$

We'll next need a way to express our Volume at any given $i$:

$$ V_i = \left(\text{length}\right)\left(\text{width}\right)\left(\text{height}\right) $$

$$ V_i = 15s_i\Delta x $$

Note that we'll need to express this in terms of $x_i^*$. To find this, we'll
need to relate $s_i$ to $x_i^*$. Because we are working with similar triangles,
we can relate $s_i$ to one of the sides of the equilateral triangle and relate
$x_i^*$ to the height:

$$ \frac{s_i}{x_i^*} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} $$

$$ s_i = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^* $$

So our Volume formula becomes:

$$ V_i = 15\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\right)\Delta x $$

$$ V_i = \frac{30}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\Delta x $$

Next we'll need to define our Force at any given $i$. We know this to be:

$$ F_i = \text{density} \times V_i $$

And we are given the density as $62 \text{ lb}/\text{ft}^3$

$$ F_i = 62\left(\frac{30}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\Delta x\right) = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\Delta x $$

To find the Work at any given $i$, we'll need to raise this to the volume of
water at the $i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval to the top of the tank. This is simply
$h - x_i^*$, or $\sqrt{3} - x_i^*$.

$$ W_i = 62\left(\frac{30}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\Delta x\right) = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\left(\sqrt{3} - x_i^*\right)\Delta x $$

Now, to find the total amount of work, we'll have to take $W_i$ and sum it over
the entirety of $n$ subintervals.

$$ W \approx \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\left(\sqrt{3} - x_i^*\right)\Delta x} $$

And to find the exact Work, we'll have to find this as $n \to \infty$, thusly we
take a limit of the Work as $n$ approaches infinity:

$$ W = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}x_i^*\left(\sqrt{3} - x_i^*\right)\Delta x} $$

Recall that this now fits the definition of the definite integral, and so we can
express this as:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}x\left(\sqrt{3} - x\right)\, dx} $$

And evaluating this, we get our answer for the Work:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}x\left(\sqrt{3} - x\right)\, dx} $$

$$ W = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}\int_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}}{x\left(\sqrt{3} - x\right)\, dx} $$

$$ W = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}\int_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}}{\sqrt{3}x - x^2\, dx} $$

$$ W = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}\left. \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3\right) \right|_{0}^{\frac{3}{4}} $$

$$ W = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}\left[\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3\right) - \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(0)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(0)^3\right)\right] $$

$$ W = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3\right) $$

$$ W = \frac{1860}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{32} - \frac{27}{192}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{W \approx 372.1118 \text{ ft - lbs}} $$

## Assignment Problems

**1.** A force of $F(x) = x\mathbf{e}^{-2x^2} + 6x - 2$ acts on an object. What
is the work required to move the object from $x = 1$ to $x = 4$?

**Solution**

This is simple plug and play for the standard Work Formula.

$$ W = \int_{a}^{b}{F(x)\, dx} $$

$$ W = \int_{1}^{4}{x\mathbf{e}^{-2x^2} + 6x - 2\, dx} $$

$$ W = \int_{1}^{4}{x\mathbf{e}^{-2x^2}\, dx} + \int_{1}^{4}{6x - 2\, dx} $$

$$ u = -2x^2 \quad du = -4x dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad -\frac{1}{4}du = x dx $$

$$ W = \int_{1}^{4}{-\frac{1}{4}\mathbf{e}^{u}\, du} + \int_{1}^{4}{6x - 2\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(-\frac{1}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-2x^2} + 3x^2 - 2x\right) \right|_{1}^{4} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(-\frac{1}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-2(4)^2} + 3(4)^2 - 2(4)\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{4}\mathbf{e}^{-2(1)^2} + 3(1)^2 - 2(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{W \approx 39.0338} $$

**2.** A force of $F(x) = 4\cos(2x) - 7\sin\left(\dfrac{1}{2}x\right)$, $x$ is
in meters, acts on an object. What is the work required to move the object 10
meters to the right of $x = 2$?

**Solution**

Here we'll have to assume that "to the right" is a positive direction. This
means our limits of integration will be $[2, 12]$.

Other than that, this is another plug and play answer:

$$ W = \int_{2}^{12}{4\cos(2x) - 7\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(2\sin(2x) + 14\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)\right) \right|_{2}^{12} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(2\sin(2(12)) + 14\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}(12)\right)\right) - \left(2\sin(2(2)) + 14\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}(2)\right)\right)\right] $$

$$ W = \left[\left(2\sin(24) + 14\cos(6)\right) - \left(2\sin(4) + 14\cos(1)\right)\right] $$

$$ W = 2\sin(24) + 14\cos(6) - 2\sin(4) - 14\cos(1) $$

$$ \boxed{W \approx 5.5806} $$

**3.** A force of $F(x) = \sin(x)\mathbf{e}^{\cos(x)} - 4x + 1$, $x$ is in
meters, acts on an object. What is the work required to move the object 6.5
meters to the left of $x = 9$?

**Solution**

Here, we assume that moving the object to the left is negative , so our limits
of integration will be $[2.5, 9]$.

Otherwise, again, we plug and play:

$$ W = \int_{2.5}^{9}{\sin(x)\mathbf{e}^{\cos(x)} - 4x + 1\, dx} $$

$$ W = \int_{2.5}^{9}{\sin(x)\mathbf{e}^{\cos(x)}\, dx} - \int_{2.5}^{9}{4x + 1\, dx} $$

$$ u = \cos(x) \quad du = -\sin(x)dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad -du = \sin(x)dx $$

$$ W = -\int_{2.5}^{9}{\mathbf{e}^{u}\, du} - \int_{2.5}^{9}{4x + 1\, dx} $$

$$ W = -\int_{2.5}^{9}{\mathbf{e}^{\cos(x)}\, dx} - \int_{2.5}^{9}{4x + 1\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(-\mathbf{e}^{\cos(x)} - 2x^2 + x\right) \right|_{2.5}^{9} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(-\mathbf{e}^{\cos((9))} - 2(9)^2 + (9)\right) - \left(-\mathbf{e}^{\cos((2.5))} - 2(2.5)^2 + (2.5)\right)\right] $$

$$ W = \left[\left(-\mathbf{e}^{\cos(9)} - 162 + 9\right) - \left(-\mathbf{e}^{\cos(2.5)} - 12.5 + 2.5\right)\right] $$

$$ W = -\mathbf{e}^{\cos(9)} - 162 + 9 + \mathbf{e}^{\cos(2.5)} + 12.5 - 2.5 $$

$$ W = -\mathbf{e}^{\cos(9)} + \mathbf{e}^{\cos(2.5)} - 143 $$

$$ \boxed{W \approx -142.9533} $$

**4.** A spring has a natural length of 25cm and a force of 3.5 N is required to
stretch and hold the spring to a length of 32 cm. What is the work required to
stretch the spring from a length of 30 cm to a length of 45 cm?

**Solution**

For spring problems we'll want to use Hooke's Law:

$$ F(x) = kx $$

Where $k > 0$ is called the spring constant, and $x$ is the distance the spring
is stretched from its natural length.

So, let's first find the spring constant $k$. A force of 3.5 N is required to
stretch the spring the following distance:

$$ 32\text{ cm} - 25\text{ cm} = 7\text{ cm} $$

We'll need to convert this to meters as we're working with units of N.

$$ \frac{7}{100} = 0.07\text{ m} $$

We can now use this to find $k$:

$$ 3.5 = 0.07k $$

$$ k = 50 $$

Thusly our Force Formula becomes:

$$ F(x) = 50x $$

We want to know the amount of work required to stretch the spring from 30 cm to
a length of 45 cm, let's rewrite these as the form of meters for the
aforementioned reason:

$$ \frac{30}{100} = 0.3 $$

$$ \frac{45}{100} = 0.45 $$

And those are our limits of integration, let's find our Work:

$$ W = \int_{0.3}^{0.45}{50x\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(25x^2\right) \right|_{0.3}^{0.45} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(25(0.45)^2\right) - \left(25(0.3)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{W = 2.8125 \text{ J}} $$

**5.** A spring has a natrual length of 9 inches and a force of 7 lbs is
required to stretch and hold the spring to a length of 21 inches. What is the
work required to stretch the spring from a length of 12 inches to a length of 30
inches?

**Solution**

Obviously, spring problem, we use Hooke's formula.

$$ F(x) = kx $$

Let's find $k$. To do this, we'll first need to solve for $x$ when the force is
$7$ lbs.

$$ 21 - 9 = 12 $$

And convert to feet as our units are in lbs.

$$ 12/12 = 1 \text{ ft} $$

Thusly our force formula becomes:

$$ 7 = 1k $$

$$ k = 7 $$

So our Force formula becomes:

$$ F(x) = 7x $$

Again, let's convert our given stretch lengths to feet in order to get our
limits of integration:

$$ \frac{30}{12} = 2.5 $$

$$ \frac{12}{12} = 1 $$

So our limits of integration are $1 \leq x \leq 2.5$.

Now we can find our work:

$$ W = \int_{1}^{2.5}{7x\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(\frac{7}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{1}^{2.5} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(\frac{7}{2}(2.5)^2\right) - \left(\frac{7}{2}(1)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{W = 18.375 \text{ ft - lb}} $$

**6.** A cable with mass 2 kg/meter is lifting a load of 50 kg that is initially
at the bottom of a 75 meter shaft. How much work is required to lift the load 40
meters?

**Solution**

Before answering this problem, we first need to determine the force. In this
case, the force will be the weight of the load and cable at any point in the
shaft.

To determine a formula for this we will first need to set a convention for $x$.
For this problem we will set $x$ to be the amount of cable that has been pulled
up. So at the bottom of the shaft, $x$ = 0$, for example. Thusly, at any point
in the shaft there is $75 - x$ feet of cable still left in the shaft.

The force then for any $x$ is then nothing more than the weight of the cable and
the load at that point.

$$ \text{ weight of cable} + \text{ weight of load} $$

$$ 2(75 - x) + 50 $$

$$ 150 - 2x + 50 $$

$$ 200 - 2x $$

Because we are working against gravity, we'll have to multiply this by Newton's
constant of gravitional acceleration to get our Force:

$$ F(x) = 9.8(200 - 2x) $$

Our limits of integration are given to us as being $0 \leq x \leq 40$, so we can
now find our Work:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{40}{9.8(200 - 2x)\, dx} $$

$$ W = 9.8\int_{0}^{40}{200 - 2x\, dx} $$

$$ W = 19.6\int_{0}^{40}{100 - x\, dx} $$

$$ W = 19.6\left. \left(100x - \frac{1}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{40} $$

$$ W = 19.6\left[\left(100(40) - \frac{1}{2}(40)^2\right) - \left(100(0) - \frac{1}{2}(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ W = 19.6\left(100(40) - \frac{1}{2}(40)^2\right) $$

$$ W = 19.6(4000 - 800) $$

$$ \boxed{W = 62720 \text{ J}} $$

**7.** A cable with mass 1.5 kg/meter is attached to a bucket that has mass 75
kg. Initially there is 500 kg of grain in the bucket and as the bucket is raised
2 kg of grain leaks out of a hole in the bucket for every meter the bucket is
raised. The bucket is 200 meters below a bridge. How much work is required to
raise the bucket to the top of the bridge?

**Solution**

Okay, this one is similar to 6, except we have grain leaking. Let's start off
simple. Let $x$ be the amount of cable that has been raised in meters, this
means that the amount of cable that has been lifted at any given time is
$200 - x$.

We can then determine the current weight by multiplying this by the mass of the
cable (1.5 kg/meter) and also by Newton's constant of gravitational acceleration
(9.8).

$$ \text{cable weight} = (1.5)(9.8)(200 - x) $$

We'll also need to calculate the grain weight at any given $x$. The amount of
grain starts off at a total of 500 kg, but loses 2kg every meter, which in other
words, it loses 2kg every $x$. This means our grain mass can be expressed as:

$$ \text{grain mass} = (9.8)(500 - 2x) $$

We thusly can calculate our Force by adding these two as well as the mass of 75
kg:

$$ F(x) = 9.8\left[(1.5)(200 - x) + (500 - 2x) + 75\right] $$

$$ F(x) = 8575 - 34.3x $$

We are given our limits of integration as $x$ goes from $0$ distance in meters
traveled to the top of the bridge, to $200$ meters traveled to the top of the
bridge (reached the top). Our limits of integration are $0 \leq x \leq 200$, and
thusly we have all the necessary data to find our Work:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{200}{8575 - 34.3x\, dx} $$

$$ W = \left. \left(8575x - 17.15x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{200} $$

$$ W = \left[\left(8575(200) - 17.15(200)^2\right) - \left(8575(0) - 17.15(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ \boxed{W = 1,029,000 \text{ J}} $$

**8.** A tank of water is in the shape of a cylinder of height 25 meters and
radius of 7 meters. If the tank is completely filled with water how much work is
required to pump all of the water to the top of the tank. Assume that the
density of water is 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.

**Solution**

Much like Example 4, we cannot easily find the force function $F(x)$ for us to
work with. Let's establish some variables.

Let $x$ be the height of the water in the tank at any given point. Thusly when
there is no water in the tank, $x = 0$, and when the tank is full, the height of
the tank is $x = 25$. Note for later that this means our limits of integration
are $0 \leq x \leq 25$. Note also that at any point, the height of the water is
$25 - x$.

Unlike Example 4, we are dealing with a simpler shape, a cylinder, so our radius
never changes.

Thusly our Area is expressed as:

$$ A = \pi r^2 $$

$$ A = \pi (7)^2 $$

$$ A = 49\pi $$

The Volume of the water at any given time is simply this Area multiplied by the
height:

$$ V_i = 49\pi(25 - x) $$

$$ V_i = \pi(1225 - 49x) $$

And then the force of this is simply the Volume multiplied by Newton's constant
of gravitational acceleration (9.8) as well as by the density of the water.

$$ F(x) = 9.8(1000)\pi(1225 - 49x) $$

$$ F(x) = 9800\pi(1225 - 49x) $$

The Work can then be expressed as:

$$ W = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{9800\pi(1225 - 49x_i^*)\Delta x} $$

And as we know, this is the definition of a definite integral, so this can now
be expressed as:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{25}{9800\pi(1225 - 49x)\, dx} $$

We'll take the 49 out from before as well to simplify evaluating.

$$ W = 480200\pi \int_{0}^{25}{25 - x\, dx} $$

$$ W = 480200\pi \left. \left(25x - \frac{1}{2}x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{25} $$

$$ W = 480200\pi \left[\left(25(25) - \frac{1}{2}(25)^2\right) - \left(25(0) - \frac{1}{2}(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ W = 480200\pi\left(25(25) - \frac{1}{2}(25)^2\right) $$

$$ \boxed{W = 150,062,500 \text{ J}} $$

**9.** A tank of water is in the shape of an inverted pyramid that is 18 feet
tall and whose top is a square with sides 4 feet long. If there is initially 12
feet of water in the tank determine the amount of work needed to pump all of the
water to the top of the tank. Assume that the density of water is 62
lb/ft<sup>3</sup>.

**Solution**

This is very similar to Example 4 except we have an inverted pyramid instead of
an inverted cone.

Let's first establish that $x$ is the height of the water, and thusly $\Delta x$
is the total height of the wtaer and $x_i^*$ is the height of the water at any
given interval $i$ within an interval of $i = 1, 2, \dots , n$. For reference,
this means that our limits of integration down the road will be
$0 \leq x \leq 12$.

Instead of a radius here, we are dealing with a pyramid, so let's say that $s$
represents one of the sides of the square (4 ft long). This means we have a
side, $s_i$ at every interval $i$, for every height $x_i^*$.

The mass of the Volume of water at every $i$ can be expressed as:

$$ m_i = \text{ density} \times V_i $$

However, this is for mass density, and we are given weight density given the
fact that the units are British units of measurement. Thusly it would be more
apt to express this as:

$$ F_i = \text{weight density} \times V_i $$

Unlike Example 4, our Volume formula changes as we are dealing with an inverse
pyramid. Our Volume is therefore:

$$ V_i \approx (s_i)^2\left(\text{height}\right) $$

We know the height is in this case $\Delta x$.

$$ V_i \approx (s_i)^2\Delta x $$

We'll need $s_i$ in terms of $x_i^*$ in order to express our mass, and
eventually our Work in a form we can logically reason about.

Like Example 4, we can divide our pyramid down the middle to get similar
triangles and evaluate $s_i$ in terms of $x_i^*$:

$$ \frac{s_i}{x_i^*} = \frac{4}{18} $$

$$ s_i = \frac{2}{9}x_i^* $$

Plugging this into our Volume:

$$ V_i \approx \left(\frac{2}{9}x_i^*\right)^2\Delta x $$

Recall that our mass can be expressed as:

$$ F_i = \text{ weight density} \times V_i $$

And we know our density was given to us as 62 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>. So our final
mass expression is:

$$ F_i = 62\left[\left(\frac{2}{9}x_i^*\right)^2\Delta x\right] $$

$$ F_i = 62\left[\frac{4}{81}\left(x_i^*\right)^2\Delta x\right] $$

$$ F_i = \frac{248}{81}\left(x_i^*\right)^2\Delta x $$

Normally here we would calculate the Force at the given interval by multiplying
it by Newton's Constant of Acceleration, but because we are working with British
units (_i.e._ lbs/ft<sup>3</sup>), we omit it.

Next, in order to reach to the top of the tank the water in the $i$<sup>th</sup>
subinterval will need to travel approximately $18 - x_i^*$ to reach the top of
the tank. Because the volume of the water in the $i$<sup>th</sup> subinterval is
constant the force needed to raise the water through any distance is also a
constant force.

Therefore, the work to move the volume of water in the $i$<sup>th</sup>
subinterval to the top of the tank, _i.e._ raise it a distance of $18 - x_i^*$,
is then approximately,

$$ W_i \approx F_i\left(18 - x_i^*\right) = \frac{248}{81}\left(x_i^*\right)^2\left(18 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x $$

The total amount of work required to raise all the water to the top of the tank
is then approximately the sum of each of the $W_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots , n$.
Or,

$$ W \approx \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\frac{248}{81}\left(x_i^*\right)^2\left(18 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x} $$

To get the actual amount of work we simply need to take $n \to \infty$. _I.e._
compute the following limit,

$$ W = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\frac{248}{81}\left(x_i^*\right)^2\left(18 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x} $$

And this can be re-expressed as a definite integral:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{12}{\frac{248}{81}(x^2)(18 - x)\, dx} $$

Now let's evaluate and finally find the Work:

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}\int_{0}^{12}{(x^2)(18 - x)\, dx} $$

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}\int_{0}^{12}{18x^2 - x^3\, dx} $$

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}\left. \left(6x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4\right) \right|_{0}^{12} $$

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}\left[\left(6(12)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(12)^4\right) - \left(6(0)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(0)^4\right)\right] $$

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}\left(6(12)^3 - \frac{1}{4}(12)^4\right) $$

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}\left(6(1728) - \frac{1}{4}(20736)\right) $$

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}(10368 - 5184) $$

$$ W = \frac{248}{81}(5184) $$

$$ \boxed{W = 15,872 \text{ ft -lb}} $$

**10.** A tank of is the shape of the lower half of a sphere of radius 6 meters.
If the initial depth of the water is 4 meters how much work is required to pump
all the water to the top of the tank. Assume that the density of water is 1000
kg/m<sup>3</sup>.

**Solution**

This is actually another problem similar to Example 4, except we are dealing
with the lower half of a sphere as our tank instead of an inverse cone.

Let's establish $x$ as the height of the water in meters. This means that
$\Delta x$ is the entire height of the tank and $x_i^*$ is the height of the
water at any subinterval $i$ within the interval $i = 1, 2, \dots , n$, of $n$
subintervals. This means that our limits of integration down the road will be
$0 \leq x \leq 4$.

Recall from Example 4 that the mass at any interval $i$ can be expressed as:

$$ m_i = \text{ density} \times V_i $$

Where $V_i$ represents the Volume at that subinterval.

Firstly, we must establish that the Volume is simply the area of a circle times
the height of the sphere:

$$ V = \pi r^2 \left(\text{ height}\right) $$

We established earlier that we can express the height of our half sphere by
$\Delta x$:

$$ V = \pi r^2 \Delta x $$

In order to express $V_i$, we need to establish that $r_i$ is simply the radius
at any given subinterval $ji$. This evalutes to:

$$ V_i = \pi(r_i)^2\Delta x $$

In order to express $r_i$ in terms of $x_i^*$, we can't use the similar
triangles ratio we used in Example 4 (as we are dealing with a sphere and not
triangles). Thusly, in order to establish this relationship, we'll need to
revisit a standard geometry formula regarding the radius:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 $$

Here we know that $r = 6$ from the problem statement.

$$ x^2 + y^2 = 6^2 $$

$$ x^2 + y^2 = 36 $$

We need to find $r_i$. We need to reason about this carefully, the value of $x$
here is actually the radius value minus $x$ at any given $i$. Due to this, we
are not starting from the origin of the sphere, but rather at the bottom when
$x = 0$. Reasoning on this, we can ascertain that the $x$-coordinate of our tank
at any given $i$ is $x - 6$. This changes our radius formula to:

$$ (x - 6)^2 + y^2 = 36 $$

We'll need $y$ in terms of $x$ in order to find $r_i$ in terms of $x_i^*$:

$$ y^2 = 36 - (x - 6)^2 $$

$$ y = \sqrt{36 - (x - 6)^2} $$

This is the radius at any given $i$, as this relates to the height of the water
(which is the radius at $i$). Thusly this becomes:

$$ r_i = \sqrt{36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2} $$

This allows us to express $V_i$ in terms of $x_i^*$:

$$ V_i = \pi\left(\sqrt{36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2}\right)^2\Delta x $$

$$ V_i = \pi\left(36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2\right)\Delta x $$

In order to find $m_i$, we'll need to multiply the $V_i$ by the given density:

$$ m_i = 1000\left[\pi\left(36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2\right)\Delta x\right] $$

And in order to calculate the force, $F_i$, we'll need to multiply $m_i$ by
Newton's Constant of gravitational acceleration.

$$ F_i = (9.8)1000\left[\pi\left(36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2\right)\Delta x\right] $$

In order to find an approximation for $W_i$, we'll need to also multiply this by
the current distance from the top of the tank, which is $6 - x_i^*$:

$$ W_i = (9.8)1000\left[\pi\left(36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2\right)\left(6 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x\right] $$

And in order to find $W$, we'll have to sum all $W_i$ up until the total number
of subintervals, $n$:

$$ W \approx \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(9.8)1000\left[\pi\left(36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2\right)\left(6 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x\right]} $$

And take the limit as $n \to \infty$:

$$ W = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(9.8)1000\left[\pi\left(36 - \left(6 - x_i^*\right)^2\right)\left(6 - x_i^*\right)\Delta x\right]} $$

Which can be expressed as a definite integral:

$$ W = \int_{0}^{4}{(9.8)1000\left[\pi\left(36 - (6 - x)^2\right)(6 - x)\right]\, dx} $$

Evaluate to find our total Work:

$$ W = (9.8)(1000)\pi\int_{0}^{4}{\left(36 - (6 - x)^2\right)(6 - x)\, dx} $$

$$ W = 9800\pi\int_{0}^{4}{x^3 - 18x^2 + 72x\, dx} $$

$$ W = 9800\pi\left. \left(\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 6x^3 + 36x^2\right) \right|_{0}^{4} $$

$$ W = 9800\pi\left[\left(\frac{1}{4}(4)^4 - 6(4)^3 + 36(4)^2\right) - \left(\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - 6(0)^3 + 36(0)^2\right)\right] $$

$$ W = 9800\pi\left(\frac{1}{4}(4)^4 - 6(4)^3 + 36(4)^2\right) $$

$$ W = 9800\pi(64 - 384 + 576) $$

$$ W = 9800\pi(256) $$

$$ \boxed{W = 2,508,800\pi \text{ J}} $$
